They have these big obsessions about sex witch I have never seen in my entire life but only in US movies. I really can't get it. I have had attacks for me for being idk \"social-wise\" different. I find everything 18-35 year-olds do very non-understanding, not offensive or inappropriate but just WEIRD cause I don't understand it. Yes I'm a virgin but because I don't understand the hype about sex between these young people. I mean I certainly notice people I like to glance at but I don't have the nerve to make a sexual-romantic tension like these people do. I am living a 40's lifestyle (when everything was about moms &amp; apple pies and all that) not the rock and post rock lifestyle. I cann't get the empathy and grasp on what's happening. My parents do understand it but I don't. I can't fit in anywhere because of it. I am used to this asexuality and hermit coldness that I give out towards people. But I realize now I need to change. How do I become more westernized? I wore a turban multiple times for sake.

            "suicide - Is there a flaw in my logic?A common deterrent from suicide is that it’s “selfish to leave your loved ones behind” and things of the like. I understand. However, at what point does it become acceptable to look out for yourself? Im so fucking tired of dragging myself on in my shitty day to day existence when I have nothing to live for or look forward to. I don’t want to live for the sake of others. **Is it not selfish to force someone to live just for your own happiness at the cost of theirs?** The burden is too much. Im not a father nor am I a husband. Objectively speaking: No one NEEDS me, they just really really want me around. **When people get cancer and die, the go-to quote is “Atleast they aren’t suffering anymore.” So why is it wrong to want the same thing for myself? To be free from this torture.** I cant take this shit anymore. \n",

            "I’m in the second group, so I’ll be going to school in-person for Thursday and Friday, and for the past two days I’ve been doing school online. And these past two days of online school have drained what little sanity I had left after 5 months of quarantine. The teachers are supposed to assign like one or two things to do per online day, so I thought everything was going to be easy. But no. One of my teachers has been having constant technology problems with assignments being locked or not working, and I’m already a little behind on stuff. All of my other teachers have been mostly fine, but this one class has been diverting all of my attention to that class and away from my other classes, causing me to fall behind. And because of all of my attention being diverted to this one class that keeps having problems, I now have a lot more stuff to do in all my other classes that I don’t want to do because I’ve lost all motivation to do anything in my other classes due to the constant problems. The worst part is is that I haven’t even met half of my teachers and I have a million questions that I can’t ask in person due to the situation we’re in rn due to covid. And the questions I do have haven’t really been answered or I haven’t gotten a clear answer, so I don’t know what to do half the time. I’m the type of person that functions the best when I’m in school 5 days a week, even though school sucks sometimes. In person school is 10x better than online school in my opinion. Online school, even though it seems easy, doesn’t work well with me. I’m about done with technology at the moment. It’s great when it works, but it sucks when it doesn’t work. All I want to say. This is my rant on online school.\n",

            "suicide - 12 05 18This is the date of my birthday this year.. I’m not sure if it worth living another year of being wrongfully accused of being reverse racist and misogynistic. It’s been five years sense being home from where they sent me to recondition me. To no addvail. Because there was nothing wrong with what I had in or over the situation. I was attack and assaulted sexually when I was drugged while drinking with friends at a beach party. And then was raped in full view of everyone. After hours of being blacked out and what I’ve been made to come to terms about that all being molestation. They scantalized a story about how I was a scared virgin and made up the part about being raped. I just know that I wouldn’t have blacked out after fifteen minutes. Me being a scared virgin is part of the point of why I know what I wanted out of my life at the time and It Was Not Her. I’m only predisposed to alcohol to not get hangovers and be able to drink two forties at a time all sophomore and freshman year. So the roofied and drugged my liquor cause I still wouldn’t have given this person time of day over the facts that she was the school whore slut and was fucking guys over her moms money and drugs. I never had anything to do with this person till they raped me over me being bullied from a person that wanted to say I was mommy confused over me wanting to date my girlfriend. And stay our selves while we me and my girlfriend not my rapist opened up to one another sexually. By the time I was waking up from the painkiller roofie she was raping me and molesting the type of person I was over her thinking I was hers. And not to my own. With the person that I wanted to be with. Now I’m suicidal cause I has stunts against medication cause of how I was roofied. My counseling staff wants me to fuck off cause I’m not trying. When I’m working as much as I can to understand why meds have to be the only thing they can offer me to get over being raped with drugs. My mother wants to block this as nothing but a delusion cause she basically let it happen. I just know that’s not worth knowing that every other person have had their own say with out taking who or what I’ve been through to heart.. I’m hoping to kill myself. So that I don’t have to keep saying the same thing that pretty much only makes me look like a crazy freak. Or like I don’t know what people are or capable of. Why should I look like a freak so that people who can say I’m only wanting something from them. When all I’m fucking saying that I never wanted anything from them based on who they were not just to me. I didn’t want to be their friends or know what they weee like cause they did their best to make me out to be some one who want to trauma grab over them raping the experience and expectations of who I was to me my friends. And the people who actually saw me shine for who I was to them. Not my mom. Not the bullies.. but the people that actually saw me for me with them. Not just the me they wanted over them. \n",

            "suicide - I don't know what it is anymore.I don't know what's bothering me right now, but it is not a good feeling. I don't know what went wrong with me. I could have sworn that I was doing fine... Or at least made it seem to look like everything was going fine.  I feel like I'm trapped and uncomfortable,  it is making me go mad. I just feel like ending my life,  I just find it too much for me to take in. But at the same time,  I don't want that for me.  I just want to be happy and healthy,  having a chance of living my life as I should be, but it's becoming too much for me,  I am not sure how I am going to handle the Spring semester back in college from my winter break. This uncomfortable depression is not letting me live my life to how I would want to improve.  I'm scared for my life,  I do self harm from time to time but it's not deep at all.  To say at the least that I don't think I can make it far this time.  I feel like my clock is ticking and the scary thing is that no one would have never suspect it if I was ever to have a problem at all. I'm anxious all the time, and I do get sad,  but I don't want to live this slow,  dark life anymore.  I want to be happy so bad and this time I ran out of ways of reaching out to anyone.  It's just me and God.  Only God knows what will happen to me.  Although all I can do is pray to God, but I am scared of what can happen to me as I wait for my prayers to be answered.  Yes,  I've tried talking to my family,  friends and mentors but they either say it is a phase,  or Just Seek God or I just have no reason to feel this way.  This feeling/thoughts of ending my life/hurting myself has become troubling,  I am not sure if I should consider seeking treatment,  or admit myself to the hospital for my own safety... I am just confused at this point. \n",

I’m hiding in my room and they are throwing a fit about it. Two years ago, within a week of each other, my sister, best friend and girlfriend all attempted suicide. I had to rush home to be at my sister’s side, and literally had to hear my mom say that I should focus on her and just forget about the other two also in the hospital who’s side I couldn’t be at. I feel guilty because I didn’t even know my sister was feeling so alone. We were so close, all each other had growing up, I have been blind since birth and she was my rock, always willing to take up for me when no one else was. I always told all three of them that they were worth it, that they were good enough, I did my best to show how much they meant to me. My sister is ok and my friend is to. But the thought of my mother almost losing her daughter had numbed her, almost to the point where it seems she is now spiteful and cruil. I know she is hurting, but how can she tell me to move on when she hasn’t done the same? The last message I got from my girlfriend was that she would be ok, then she went radio silent. It hurts. Damn it fucking hurts. I did my best to be loyal, true, caring, kind, and honest. I would have done anything for her, I have only ever loved one other person in my life that was a romantic interest. I just feel like I didn’t do enough. Was there something else I could have said? Something else I could have done? Maybe been there more? I talked to all three of them every day? Maybe tried to find more ways to make them smile, they always told me I was the best thing in their lives. Now I’m afraid to open up to anyone else for fear of getting so truly hurt again. And I’ve heard it all before, there was nothing else you could have done, you did all you could, you can’t let this hold you back but on nights when everyone is sleeping i still cry. It is August now, and the pain and guilt and anger and fear have all come crashing back the way it does each time September gets near. And I’m so lucky to have the people I do in my life, I don’t know how to get therapy in my state, I had counseling but they stopped when all this Covid crap started and I just need a friend.\n",

            "suicide - I am lost and feel so miserable againWell, let's just say it in short: I am failing my college degree, 2nd semester. I want to drop out of it. Feel like I am the biggest failure and have no way out. Went home to my parents who made me feel like shit. I am a joke to them. They don't take me, my opinions or my feelings serious. Not even a tiny bit. They don't even attempt to understand me. My idea was to get some shit job. Yes, I know it won't be fun and easy peasy but I don't know anymore so I thought I take a break because I feel really done for to the point of wanting to kill myself. But then my parents were like that is pathetic etc. And I can't go weak and continue this shitty degree because then I will kill myself. I have no interest for it, I have no talent for it and I am too far behind it is IMPOSSIBLE to catch up. It makes me want to kill myself. So 3 reasons against it or even 4. Only started that degree because I didn't know what to do and because my father really really wanted me to do it (he has that degree) Well, now I relaxed for a few days and today I actually felt alright and a bit positive and was about to really research tomorrow what I want to do. If another degree is for me. Idk. But the my father made an \"appointment\" for tomorrow afternoon to discuss my future and then again had this \"in the first semester I sucked in that degree as well but then it all turned out well and I got the best exam\" speech and wants me to print out the funking time table of my two semesters for tomorrow's discussion. WHAT IS THAT SUPPOSED TO DO? Well, all this achieved is make me feel like shit again, extremely terrified and miserable, wanting to kill myself. He obviously wants to force me into continuing that degree and my father is horrible and he will have one of his 3 hour shit speeches tomorrow which only reach the goal of mental torture. I don't know how I am going to survive this. I wanted to research the next few days and managed to get at least a slight positive outlook and now everything is crushed and I just want to freaking end it right now. Would be better. I just hate my life, the failure I am and I am reminded why I have issues with my parents which I somehow forgot a bit in the time I spent living on my own.\n",

Everything was going well for me after successfully picking myself up from my last stint in the hospital for mental health and yet, I am worse than I’ve ever been. I moved across country, found a great job, fell in love, and moved (again) to restart (what I thought was,) the rest of my life. My depression creeped back after the season change as it was the first time I’d experienced it since moving away from California (lived there for about a year and a half without issues with depression.) Recurring memories of being abused when I was 17 would flood my dreams because it had happened during the season change and I hadn’t lived in a place other than where I grew up for that time of the year. It felt different to not be depressed in California as opposed to Colorado where I am now. My ex (almost fiancé but I was experiencing severe bipolar mood swings that caused me to try and eliminate the recurring memories of being abused by trying to be intimate with someone of the opposite gender ) left me and I’ve been struggling to figure out my future ever since. It’s mostly because we had our whole lives in front of us and I just can’t live with what I’ve done to someone I truly loved. I walk with my head down every day and I feel unwanted and worthless. I’ve never been so depressed in my life. I’m on medication for my depression and have been for a few months but I still know how I truly feel about myself and what I have to live with. My head is plagued with thoughts of ending my life on a daily basis as soon as I wake up. I say that because it is a normal thought in my head and it is not something I see as irregular or threatening to myself. I lack purpose within and I don’t know when or how things will get any better for me as I just continue on this bipolar spiral every few years.

So pretty much everything shy of ECT's. The only thing that even slightly helps is the therapy, and only because of my therapist. But it only works on days I go. I go once every two weeks (down from once a week for about the first year), but it only helps on the days I go. I have discussed this with her, but there isn't much she can do.

Kate was the first woman to ever come on to me, so that took a lot of pressure off. We fell madly in love with each other. After we had dated a little over a year, we moved out together. We didn't have a thing in common, except we loved each other. I think we were both just desperate to love someone. Anyway, she was very good to me, but I wasn't so much to her. Not at all actually, I treated her like crap. I never hit her or cheated on her or anything, but I wasn't open-minded and we fought over any little disagreement until I got her to submit.

Of course me being a stubborn dipshit (who in his own mind didn't see that he treated her badly) broke down. It tore my heart in half. It collapsed my already fragile psyche. The fighting got worse after that, and I constantly brought up the marriage thing. A little while after, I started becoming obsessed with another woman and started sending her sexually deviant things in the mail and, as I got worse, emails, all while I was still with Kate. The emails is when I got caught. I was arrested and spent a night in jail before posting bond. When I got out, I came clean and told her everything. She was of course shocked and disgusted, but after awhile, she decided she would still try and make it out. My crime was published in the paper the next morning and she was going to leave to stay at her dad's awhile. I made the mistake of saying I was going to kill myself when she left.

            "suicide - Why I'm unfortunately still aliveIdk why I'm even saying this. Not looking for pity or anything like that. I guess maybe I have the smallest amount of hope that saying(or typing) this will make me feel slightly better. (Doubtful) So the two reasons I've yet to kill myself, even though the sweet release of death is something I've craved for as long as I can remember. 1. I've done great deals of research on suicide and its various methods. Thru this research, I've discovered only one method that is both foolproof and seemingly painless(or as close to painless as killing yourself can possibly be). This would be, of course, jumping from a great height. Ideally, a building of 35+ stories. The reason I have yet to do this is that there is always the very distinct possibility of harming another human being. Someone will either see me smack the pavement with a horrendous thud, and very possibly be horrifically traumatized by this. Or worse, landing on someone and almost undoubtedly ending their life inadvertently. If this, however, was the only reason, it would not be enough to stop me. I would take that plunge in an instant, giving zero fucks about the consequences. Which leads us to reason number 2. My older sister, my mother's only other child, died a little over two years ago. This destroyed my mother. And I feel that if I were to also die young (currently 22), she would lose what little sanity she has held onto. I'm disgusted in myself for resenting my sister for this because, as I stated earlier, I've been wanting to die so desperately for years. So, I'm seemingly trapped in this miserable existence by nothing other than my own principles and my love for my mother. I wish I could just do it but I can't. Again, I don't know why the fuck I'm saying this. Maybe someone else on the depression subreddit will gain valuable insight from this but I find that to be highly unlikely. I'm just screaming into the void, aren't I...\n",

            "suicide - I don’t know what to do anymore?Hey this is my first post on here, I’m 16 (M) and having the worst time in my life. I do apologize in advance for having any spelling errors. So let’s start my life story, For about 10 years my parents always fought. There wasn’t a time in my life where they haven’t fought it was impossible to go one week without hearing them yell and shout back and fourth. Me and all my siblings want them to get a divorce but my dad isn’t signing the divorce papers and my mom is scared to tell anyone because my father had brainwashed and blackmailed the living shit out of her. We live in a 2 story apartment, and we are the home owners. My dad is a compete cheapskates he buys us the bare minimum in food and whatever just so it would be cheaper than paying child support. My mom is the opposite she is unemployed and my dad gives her money to spend on us. She puts her self in debt more and more when we need basic necessities. The only problem is whatever she buys us she is always like “oh your father wouldn’t buy you this” and then rubs it in our face. It’s terrible there is so much shit going on. On top of all that I’m fat and ugly. I was never taught or never saw love from my parents. I don’t know how to love a girl properly. My father didn’t really care at all for my mother never bought gifts or did anything. My whole family is just a burden on him, he doesn’t see us as a family but as a expense. \n",

            "You may be guessing what my personality is like. I suffer from intense anxiety and depression. Everything bothers me and puts worry on my heart the more and more I think about it. I try to tell my self I don’t give a fuck but I can’t, I just get deeper and deeper with my thoughts. At school I have “friends” not true friends but “friends”. I might have 5-10 people I can call a “friend” but I’m most certain that they are just using me for school work or just being nice because they feel a sense of pity towards me.  I could say I don’t really have a real friend just people I talk to when they need something. \n",

I feel like they are just telling me that out of pity. I also stutter and mumble a lot when I talk. I can sometimes be out going or be quite. \n",

It’s all bullshit someone is paying them or they are getting a benefit in one way or another. I’ve been having suicidal thoughts maybe about 6-7 years I’ve always been a bitch and never done anything about it. My father and mother even told me if I kill my self that they will cry for a day or two and then forget about me. Then at least I’ll be cheaper on him. My dad even told me in my face and my siblings that he wish we would die or never been born so he wouldn’t spend money on us.\n",

You can't find a relevant rock band of which he doesn't own at least one CD.

Most of the debts are due to my cat getting sick (in and out of the emergency vet about five times in the past year, which cost me around $600 a visit) and my car having trouble (new transmission, and I can't afford to invest in a new one).

I developed practical laboratory and field skills. I took modules on statistics. In my spare time, I read deeply into philosophy (specifically, moral philosophy, epistemology and the philosophy of science) and history. I studied physics and mathematics to the best of my amateur ability. I learned how to code in and designed, from scratch, a model to simulate the life cycle of stars.

Sales value, customer response scores and other metrics – in each and every single field, I was ahead of the rest of the pack by a considerable margin.

She regularly took 5 or 10 minutes extra on all of her breaks. She ostentatiously avoided shop-floor duties, with the burden again falling to other people. She would spend substantial periods of time talking in the stockroom avoiding floor duties. What was her reward for this? Fast-track into management. How did this happen? She was doing a basic Level 3 retail apprenticeship, equivalent to a single A Level.

The degree of misanthropy you succumb to varies from person to person. A few people don’t experience any such misanthropy at all. In the middle of the distribution curve, most people range from minor disdain to actively avoiding people unless necessary. At the tail end of the spectrum, some people develop a pristine, fundamental hatred for all humanity and begin to treat exposure to other humans in any capacity as they treat exposure to radioactive substances: deeply unpleasant and bad for your health. \n",

I spend every waking moment of every day apoplectically, murderously enraged, wallowing in abyssal despair, hatred and disdain felt towards almost everybody around me. I have a constant headache because of this, and I feel perpetually exhausted, both physical and mentally. I can’t even escape by indulging in sleep – not only is sleep a luxury in retail (it is possible to have 8 hours between shifts – yes, 8 hours in which to travel from and to work, sleep, eat and clean), the few hours of sleep I do get are beset with violent, genocidal dreams and frankly tiresome displays of egregious violence and manifestations of pure, evil hate. I bore myself – even I don’t escape from my pervading misanthropy. Navigating life with this worldview is the metaphysical equivalent of swimming through hot tar.\n",

            "\n",
            "The foundations of the monuments of human misgivings that constitute the average person are that most people don’t even see me as a human, as an actual person with feelings, thoughts and interests. They treat me worse than they would treat a dog. To them, I am nothing more than an automaton made of meat that exists to serve their every whim. That’s it. The various expressions of this belief grate on you immensely. \n",

            "First of all, people don’t even deign to *look* at you when speaking to you, or when you’re speaking to them. They don’t even look at you. Looking at you validates your existence too much. You’re not even important or meaningful enough to be *looked at* when being spoken to. This is such a small thing, but it is aggravating because it is universal, consistent and predictable. Quite often, I will ask people for help, and they don’t even turn around. They just hold out the item they want, specify size or colour whilst looking at the wall and just expect me to summon it into their hands. That’s how much respect people have for me. \n",
            "\n",
            "Secondly, people continually interrupt me when talking to them. Quite often, I am explaining relevant information to them, such as how to return items, how to order items, how I can do x, y and z for them and just interrupt me, asking a question whose answer I have literally just provided. Quite often they will dismissively wave their hand in agitation when you’re answering a question they’ve asked, silencing you like you’re a belligerent animal. By what right do they treat me like this?\n",
            "\n",
            "Thirdly, oftentimes they just ignore you outright. If you intrude upon their experience of consciousness after forcibly making your existence known to them, it is common for them just to look at you in *disgust*. Your very existence is an affront to their conceited sensibilities. They’ll often snap something at you or outright tell you to go away. One example is: I can say to people “Just give me a shout if you want any help,” and then I’ll walk away and they can call me if they need me. I won’t be pushy or overbearing with them. I invite them to conduct their shopping experience on their terms. Oftentimes, I will say “Just give me a sh-“ before they interrupt with “YES I’M FINE THANK YOU”. They don’t even listen to what I say to them. “Fine, thanks,” is not a coherent response to “Hello.”\n",

And consequently, because this is effectively the only experience I have with people, I stop seeing them as humans and begin seeing them as cattle. I see them as tatty chickens pecking barren dirt for scraps of refuse. That’s what they are. They are just meat stock. They are things that move around and make noise. They are non-entities, they are just temporary delays in a universal slide toward entropy, and their meaningless, fleeting existences will be deservedly extinguished long before they can comprehend the pointless conditions of their own pathetic existence.

            "I could find this treatment more palatable if I was an idiot who was capable of doing nothing else, but I’m not. I am not fulfilling 1% of my potential here.

Most often, your free time is split into two uselessly small fragments at the beginning and end of the day. For example, a 10-7 shift leaves you with, arguably, 4 free hours: 2 from 6-8, and 2 from 8-10. This is absolutely useless. These are anti-social hours. Little to no social clubs convene at these times.

It’s common knowledge that routine the most important building block of an exercise regime, and retail permits none at all. You can’t say “on Monday I will go to the gym, on Tuesday I will have a piano lesson, on Wednesday I will go to chess club”. None of these options are available to you. I understand that other jobs have time demands as well, but very few jobs indeed prohibit you from doing anything all in the same pervasive way that retail does.

You can watch some mindless shit on TV, eat some subpar food because you don’t have the time to cook properly, let alone cultivate cooking skills in the first place. To say that this existence is depressing is like saying the surface of the sun is warm. This isn’t life. It’s a living death. If you while away every hour of your life, you while away your life.

I don’t want to vocalise my thoughts on anything because they have no justification in being sprung forth from a poisoned spring. Nothing I say or think is important or interesting to others, and by revealing the contents of my mind I expose myself to invasion and observation, therefore giving others an opportunity to see what a corrupted, hopeless and resentful wretch I am.

I have systematically failed to apply them in any constructive way over the course of my entire life, through a combination of laziness, a lack of confidence, and a lack of a work/life balance.

But I keep getting rejected for tenancy by landlords because my job isn’t good enough. The minimum salary requirements are 2.5x your monthly rent, which I meet for all of the places I would like to live in, but I am continually out-competed by men and women who are surely less intelligent and industrious than me nonetheless.

Adam Smith identified this as being the mark of a brute, and he was right, and this is me. I feel guilty for being around people because I just make things worse for them. Everybody is better off without me being around on this basis. I cause them nothing but hardship and misery.

            "As of the 28th of November 2019, I have thought about death, suicide or being dead on a daily basis for roughly 3 years. There have been ups and downs across this three-year period. There are a few weeks where I only think about death for a couple of minutes of every day, often in bed at night before sleeping. There are periods of time where I sit in my room in the dark, alone, and think intensely about different methods of suicide, what the experience will be like for myself and those who find me afterwards, and what it will be like to be dead. \n",
            "\n",
            "Over the three years, I have tended, unfortunately, toward increasing morbidity and hopelessness. For the past 12 months, I have thought about death almost constantly over the course of each day, from the moment I wake up to the moment I go to sleep. Even if I’m with friends, family or loved ones, I’m thinking about death. Whether we’re watching a film together, having a meal together or doing anything together, the chances are I’m thinking about death.\n",

I’m having a meal, I think about slitting my throat with the knife I’m using. I’m in bed, I think about suffocating myself with my pillow. I’m sitting doing nothing, I fantasise about hanging myself, shooting myself, or exit-bagging myself, thinking about what it will feel like and what will happen when people find me.\n",

            "People often tell me I seem quiet, or distant, or tired. Sometimes, increasingly, they tell me I’m not my “usual self”, whatever my usual self is. There appears to be a vague, distant awareness among people around me that something isn’t quite right about me. Some of them genuinely have no idea what is going on because they aren’t perceptive enough. Some of them know something is seriously wrong but they lack the courage or the requisite care for me to do anything about it. Nobody knows how deep and pervasive these feelings really are. I was recently shocked to learn that my colleagues perceive me as a happy, upbeat and positive person. Few things surprise me, but this most certainly did. I find it hard to believe that almost everybody has no inkling at all of what is going on beneath the surface. I am not merely just quiet or serious in nature.\n",

I used to be so happy, hopeful and loving. I know that I am irreparably broken because I know if a golden olive branch was extended to me, I would bat it away out of spite. Psychologically, I am beyond salvation. Nothing can make me happy. I don’t know whether this is because I am aware of some objective truths about the nature of life in general and the conditions of my own life, or if I am trapped in subjective thought processes that don’t hold up, or if the proportion of regret and resentment as a function of a life that has simply passed me by is too much for one person to bear.

We were talking to each other day/night I really started liking her but she liked another guy and he fucked her life up and left her. After that she didn't like anyone else and always ignored me. Then I started going out a bit and started looking quite fine but then still I was weird and I still don't have anyone who calls me or anyone who wants to hang out . I didn't go to college for a month and no one even texted/called me to check on me. My father is sick right now and he is in his 60's and it's really hard for me to manage everything from social anxiety to responsibilities to studies and being good everywhere. No one cares about me and neither do I have money. I've to cook food and give it to my family and then do other stuff. It's really hard for me as I am just 17ish. Back to the girl, she started hating me because I started liking her over the internet and so she never came to met me. We were supposed to meet on my birthday which is on 28th of June but she cancelled the plans on my birthday. I spent my birthday alone sleeping. Now I missed some exams and I like to study but I haven't so its freaking me out because I don't want to fail and be the one left out. I want to have a normal life like my friend who has everything given by his parents including a bike and lots of money and lots of money for school and other stuff, all he gotta do is wake up, sit on his bike, go to college, study, give exams, come home and enjoy. For me its like wake up prepare food, get some money, give it to famil,y go to college , if not then sleep at home and play some online games, feel bad about myself and then get no love. Help please.\n",

She was the only thing in my life and now after 2 years that she's gone I feel so alone, I can't imagine the fact that she will like someone else and probably things will happen, my anxiety is getting to me and I am getting violent. I am really tall and strong so in anger I just knocked out a guy who was troubling me to a point where he lost his front teeth. Well, I regret doing that and I feel guilty but he deserved it though. But Idk if I should kill myself so that the ones who left me and the ones who are making me suffer will feel guilty? \n",

Our school just got a new band director this year and a lot of the kids are upset because she is more strict than our last one. Last year I had a few friends in this class, but all of them quit including the ones who told me to stay with them in band cuz they didn't want to be alone. So at the start of this year I was pretty much alone in band, but I got lucky when this one guy started talking to me. He's a brass player, so he sits in the back and I sit in the front because I'm a woodwind player. We talked while packing up and texted in class. He was the only person in this class I talked to because all the people who begged me to stay freaking quit. And now he's quiting too and I'm going to have no friends and be alone at pep band, concerts, and this class. I'm so upset about it especially because he doesn't understand why I would be upset. I'm even more pissed off about him not telling me this in advance. And just this week I've been comforting and helping him through his first break up. He had several chances to tell me, but instead he just left me high and dry. I feel so upset with him, but I don't want to get mad at him because he did nothing inherently wrong.

There's the possibility of it improving, sure, but I know better than to get my hopes up.  I'm in love with one of my best friends, but she doesn't feel the same.  I'm okay with that fact, and I've been putting on a cheerful facade so she doesn't blame herself for my suffering.  She's honestly one of the main reasons I get out of bed anymore, but I just feel so alone.  I fear that no one will ever love me, and I fear that I will lose the strength within myself to pursue my happiness.  I have no real plans to commit suicide.  I know the impact it would have on my loved ones, and I'm afraid of my consciousness fading away, yet I still wish for death.  I know that I'm not in my right mind, and I'm sure as hell not going to act out impulsively and do something rash, but I can't stop thinking about it.  I don't expect anyone to actually care, but it's nice to vent.  \n",

            "suicide - So many people have done so many fucked up things to me that I can't even tell if it's real or just something my paranoid mind made up.Yesterday a bus driver drove straight past me then tried to blame me for it and said the bus-stop wasn't for getting on the bus, I told him he was talking shit and he refused to let me buy a ticket so I went and sat down. Then, he told me he was going to get the police to come and get me off so I told him I was annoyed because I'm differently abled and he tried to drive past me for no reason then kick me off the bus and that he could suck my balls. This stuff doesn't happen to normal people. Everytime I get in a relationship with a girl they do fucked up things to me like hit me, try to stop me from talking to my friends and I wouldn't let that shit slide these days but the emotional scars are still there. When I was a child my parents abandoned me. I was sexually abused a few times. My teachers were horrible to me because I had health conditions that made being in school terrible for me and I refused to go there. Even when I went to college the tutors called me out in front of the whole class for problems relating to my learning difficulty. Then my ex ruined a whole bunch of my coursework, cheated on me, told everyone I was abusing her. The only reason I haven't killed myself yet is because of my undeniable potential and my girlfriend. I just can't take it tho. I'd never tell her until after, I don't want to cause her any more suffering than I'm going to. Every time I defy the odds and dig myself out of these holes someone kicks me back down into it again. They wouldn't even take me seriously when I tried to get help for my mental health. I'm too mentally unwell to work or even go out of the house so I don't really have a choice, it's inevitable. I tried to hang myself about 2 weeks ago and it feels like a mixture between when you stand up too fast and pass out and when you lie upside down and all of the blood goes to your head. Wasn't sure if I was dead or alive for a while I was having an existential crisis. Sometimes I fantasise about my girlfriend killing me, she's nice and she has a face like a model. It wouldn't be as scary that way but it would be pretty messed up and scary knowing the consequences for her. Reality and fantasy are different things tho I guess. I wish it just happened and I had no control over it but maybe I'll like killing myself in a self-punishment kind of way. I wish more people understood, my life belongs to me and my only true right is the right to end it. People for the most part have a very immature outlook on death, they think they want to go to an afterlife or whatever but I accept the nothingness. It sounds so peaceful to me now. It used to bother me allot when I was around 12 and I wish death was still disturbing to me. I know it's supposed to be. That's why religion is so popular I guess. Going to go play chess now. Might do it if I find my testicles. Don't join me. I hope my brains impaired enough that this won't be convincing to anyone. I'm probably deleting this just incase. \n",

            "So starting from the first 10 years of my life I was born to a very poor family my mother suffers from terrible mental disorders that causes her to do things she believes is the proper way this will be relevant later on. Shortly after I was born from a drunken conduct of my father and mother, my father was forced to leave as my mother was unstable and refused to work or do any form of daily care to the homes they lived in. It is important to note I am the second child brought into the environment. Custody battles started from the moment I turned 3 as my mother deemed me and my brother ineligible to consume any food due to fake allergies to get more money from the state in which she would spend on herself. We lived in more homes then I can even remember however 9/10 were condemned shortly after us moving due to the condition they would be left in from the odor to the pure destruction that was infested with various types of bugs and molds, the only time she would clean when either when cps or someone similar was doing a check up to this day were still not sure how she managed to find out even about the surprise checkups or when the church goers would come and help her clean. All the time we would be visiting our father once a week if we were lucky where we could lead a somewhat normal life for a day or once a month two days in a row. Growing up we got fed less and less while my mother would get fatter and fatter rude to say but I’m not sure what else I can say to describe it. I distinctly remember how she would go out and party leaving me between the ages of 3-10 (because it happened as I was growing up and potentially younger) and my brother 6-13 alone for hours and constantly bring back strange men who later I learned were taking turns going down on her. One man even sat me on his lap and taught how to snap as his friend was having his turn, note she was not doing this for money but for her own pleasure. In between her parties and in house visits she would get bored and either beat, berate, or sexually abuse me and my brother. Be it with wooden spoons tree branches knives make shift whips or anything else she could get her hands on it would be used. Once I bit my brother because he made me mad over what I cannot remember but to retaliate against me my mother bit my arm with full force taking the chunk of skin with it forcing her to take me to the hospital in which she lied and said I “fell while running”. This all would continue until I was around 10 when I wound up overdosing on the various medicines she would force into me from prescription to ones she bought on the street. This was fast acting as well because at 10 I weight roughly about 30 pounds and that forced the doctors hand to call the police. So the custody battles I talked about before finally made progress and we were allowed to live with our dad and see our mother every other Saturday however things continued to go downhill she kept giving me various drugs on her visitations and when my dad found out he got it to supervised visitations once a month in which numerous things happened that we’re both embarrassing and flat out negligent during those visitations despite it being supervised until the court in the paperwork deemed it to have to be at a McDonald’s or other major fast food place as they have CCTV and usually populated in which things seemed to calm down for at least a year or so. \n",

            "However things started spiraling downhill in my fathers house as well. We were brought into a home with my unofficial Stepmother(SM) they never married and don’t plan on it due to costs and her daughter who were going to call entitled daughter or ED for short. ED was given the world and could do no wrong where as I was put at the center for everything going wrong no matter what it was or if I even had anything to do with it. This led to me constantly getting screamed at by everyone my father SM and ED and it just got to the point where I refused to leave my room until everyone was sleeping. It was at this time my SM mother began getting sick so we moved into her trailer to help take care of her and she treated me like an actual grandchild so I still do consider her my grandmother. But when we moved into this trailer me and my brother had to share a room (age 11) and things were cramped as 6 people in a single double wide is a lot. Everyone was stepping on everyone’s toes which caused people to get more and more frustrated and it all fell onto me. At this point as well ED age 16 got a bf age 32 who she began having visit and sleep over he was a greasy sleazy looking person like no shower post Malone greasy but 10x worse. Who began to also essentially scream at me for no reason I was and still am the family punching bag.\n",

            "After about half a year of moving in with grandma she got worse and my dad decided we needed to move closer to the hospital just in case so we did. We got a side by side duplex which was much closer but she worsened and me and my brother began taking care of her more and more helping her from the day to day I put in a lot of time with her to make sure she had everything and so did my brother however he would always leave with the parents to go shopping or whatever else where as I stayed and continued to help when she needed it. Halloween 2014 she passed away and it hurt everyone yet I couldn’t cry no matter how much I tried I couldn’t and I began to hate myself for this. But something happened that made things worse which was splitting up her possessions amongst the family in which SM and ED get their picks first for obvious reasons but I was left with no choice or pick because They said I didn’t do anything to help and that my brother was the one who did the most. And everything made me snap on my brother essentially blaming him in which I still regret everything I said. And I did get some items but it was a mug and a jets jacket that wound up getting ruined because of SM. \n",
            "\n",
            "Things continued like normal except I would get screamed at and blamed more and more for everything that happened in everyone’s life. Jump forward to the age of 16 we moved twice in between these moments and ED moved out to live with another bf this one her age for once and I had just started my first job in which I was forced to pay 150$ a week for rent from my 200$ paychecks and that money was used to make SM and my dads life more enjoyable as they went out and did things with my brother leaving me at home alone this morning as the first time I tried to kill myself note I’ve cut myself for years before this point but I took the knife from the drawer and I decided a man should smile in his last moments so I went to the mirror and gave myself a forced smile however from all the medicine i was given when I was younger my hands are shaky so on the right side my hand slipped and made a half smile And half frown I felt like a failure that I couldn’t even do that right so I took more pills and waited but in the end I failed and no matter how much my face healed you can still see the rise and droop on my mouth from it. No one said anything and I was kept out from school while it healed and we never talked about it again. When I turned 17 I got another job and switched to online school paying for it myself as the constant bullying and harassment in public school and was unbearable. This job payed more so my 150$ of rent jumped to 750 every two weeks from my 800$ check plus gas money so my take home is as about 20$. Their style of living went up even as my company closed its doors a year later and I was let go and switched jobs the price did not go down even when my checks went to 200$ a week again from retail. I finished HS online and paid it off and decided enough was enough and tried to kill myself again this time I went simple and sat outside in my underwear during the winter during the -5 degree Fahrenheit storm overnight. No matter how much of my body I couldn’t feel I didn’t get cold nor did I feel the want to go inside and as I laid there in the snow bank I slowly closed my eyes and fell asleep. Only I was woken up from a punch to the stomach by my father, somehow I survived the night and he needed me to shovel out his car so he could go to work my body was numb and I could hardly walk the heat from the inside felt like I was being boiled alive. About a year later 2018 I met a SSGT from United States marine corps and I liked what he was saying a family people who would believe in you and be there for you and i was hooked so I signed up and he would pick me up every day to go workout and we would go get coffee breakfast and lunch together and just talked about life I soon began spending my whole day there at the office working out from the moment he went into work to the moment he went home which generally was from 5 am to either 7 or 8 pm of just destroying my body with weights and ammo cans till my eventually ship date came. To prove that I was not welcome back they got rid of my bed and have my room already revamped into a craft room the day before I left and then I boarded the plan and left for about 3 months and I loved it there until I wound up getting severely hurt, during pugil sticks I caught a bad hit that knocked me out and gave me a concussion in which something changed and I spiraled down into depression on base and was rendered unable to train and discharged before graduating.\n",

            "I was devastated I watched the one thing I truly strived for fall apart in front of me and everything became hell the moment I made the call that I was coming home the first thing said was do you have money. Turns out my dads heart issue got worse and put him out of work for a bit and they were broker then normal so the money I earned in boot camp roughly 3k worth vanished the moment I got off Plane. I spent 1 month without a job as I wallowed in my depression as I slept on a guest cot that is falling apart with springs sticking out pushing into my back even as I write this. I got a job at a good paying rate but then rent was due 500 a week when I only made 430$ a week so I constantly owed them money was not allowed to eat the food in the house. I began spending 10$ a week in secret to store food at work so I could eat until SM lost her job as well around this time I should bring up ED moved in with her new bf late 2018 so I don’t have an actual room just a small space. I stayed at this job for almost a year until august 2019, ever since being hit in boot camp I started stuttering and it was progressively getting worse and worse as time went on until that month I couldn’t say a word without stuttering for 3 mins or longer and where I worked if you can’t speak clearly you cannot work their so I was sent away on medical disability to figure out the issue afraid their lifestyle would change too much they took me to the doctors to find out that they would have to take me to a therapist potentially and other doctors they decided that was too much work and refused to take me to them anymore. Before you say anything they are my only form of transportation because we don’t live in town and it’s too far of a walk or run. So the only reason why I’m still allowed to be here is unemployment benefits. And here I am again about to try once more as life is too much and I feel numb to everything.

            "Z was possibly the only friend I had in that school, we would play and talk together and I think she's what kept me holding on in all that loneliness when nobody else really wanted me, I felt like for once \"hey I'm not that bad\", the first time I saw was when she took my seat in the front, the seat that was meant for the person at the top of the class in studies, at first I hated her for that because it meant alot to me, I wasn't catching a break at home or at school noone ever taught how to feel noone spoke to me, the only time my family spoke to me was to tell me how much I \"don't know anything\" and that I don't \"understand anything\" instead of teaching me how act or feel. So I was really working hard to get good grades, I had to prove to my family and myself and everyone that I was smart I had nothing else to pride myself on, nothing to make me feel worth putting in the effort to keep going, I felt no self worth and this was very serious it meant if I was really what everyone said I was or if there's hope that I can learn in the future, mother would struggle teaching my older brother and sister math, I was the only one that didn't allow her to do that, my family was already making fun of me for being stupid. I wasn't smart in everything though, I didn't gain street smarts like my sister had.  And people couldn't understand why I was so fucked up, I had social anxiety, couldn't look people in the eye while talking to them I was uncomfortable around family members that weren't my direct family, I struggled in talking to people, it wasn't because I couldn't understand but I was so scared of saying something wrong or screwing up I wasn't sure of what I should say.\n",
            "The same routine would happen, my classroom still hated me and would bully me but atleast I had Z to keep me going, until 2nd grade when she moved to another school, I  stayed in that old school for another year and faced more bullying. I begged my parents to let me out of that school and move me to another one, they complied and I moved to a new school, 4th grade I entered this new school and made friends with this girl who will also become my new main bully in this school for the next 2 years not to mention that the entire class will turn on me AGAIN (_and that includes all the girls that were supposedly my friends_ ), there was nothing bad that happened between me and this girl for her to start bullying me, we would both like singing and once I got into the new school and we were in class I asked the teacher if she could let me sing in the end of the class and she let me, I was trying to prove myself hoping that they would like me, I struggled in talking but singing was something I was good at so hopefully that would help, singing was apparently her thing too, and though she never said it I believe its why she started bullying me. \n",

I have basically no family, drug addict dad who sexually assaulted me is dead, siblings are in prison for life, few friends, poorly educated/poor job prospects because I dropped out of college due to constantly being suicidal, in student loan/credit card/medical debt, can't even drive because nobody ever showed me and was always too poor to afford to pay for classes, gay, first and probably only boyfriend cheated/abused me, and much more.\n",

It's not about depression, which I don't have (at least not anymore), just logic and rational thinking. It's sometimes best to cut your losses or fold your hand.

So I travelled 3,000 miles on a bus and spent some time being homeless. After a few months of homelessness I managed to find a place to stay. Unfortunately, there really was no point to this. I still want to die. I don't actually regret doing it since the experience was kind of fun and interesting, but it fixed absolutely none of my problems. Sure, seeing new sights, experiencing different culture, and meeting new people was an interesting experience, but did it fix my irredeemable life, shitty circumstances, horrible luck, toxic past, and bleak future?

But now I just feel like that's gone, like I honestly don't want a totally fucked life after all. Because now it's all actually coming to me. I've been seeing a psychiatrist and I probably have developing schizophrenia. I literally have a psychotic episode almost every single day and I can't live like that, I don't want to, it's so fucking painful and it destroys my life. It feels like it just gets scarier every month. Thinking rationally and being in touch with reality becomes more and more difficult. Theres constantly more times when I can't even acknowledge that I'm under psychosis and I just feel like I become a completely different fucking crazy person. I'm so tired of the voices taking me over and making me completely catatonic while they tell me horrible things. I'm so tired of rambling nonsensical words and sentences for hours on end.\n",

But no one gives a shit, especially the government and the shitty system that gets to decide my life doesn't give a shit. And it's literally only going to get worse. I don't want to fight every single day for no reason while my brains keep fucking themselves more and more and making it more and more impossible for me to have any kind of a life. I don't want to end up in the fucking streets in the cold having to sell my body to some weird men who want to fuck an ugly girl. I don't have any people in my life who can support me and help me, not a single friend, parents or anything else. Soon I won't be able to live anywhere, and I can barely even eat anymore because I have so little money every month. I've tried calling places and sending in applications for support, I've fucking tried everything it's no help. I just want to find the courage to kill myself.\n",

No interest whatsoever in the whole thing. 2 exams coming up next week, both have tons of material, I haven't studied. Have no drive to. I would merrily just get the E's and be done with them, but mom obviously wants to know all the results etc. Constantly asking me if I'm studying, do I have any questions, have I received any results. I have to uphold her expectations, she was pretty much a genius, good at everything, no mental health issues or anything. I'm the opposite. Bullied since at least 8 years old, for 7-8 years.

I could change my degree next year, but that's not a particularly inviting thing either, it'd just be a repeat of the current situation. Mom said I should start looking for a summer job, preferably related to my degree. She's super enthusiastic about it and the future prospects it could bring. I can tell just by looking at her, she's very disappointed, she didn't want to have a daughter that's such massive failure. Lazy, fat, has no good qualities to speak of(this one people have argued against). My psychologist told her about my suicidal thoughts.

I block out any painful memories as much as I can, just for them to resurface at any time. I don't like to talk to people about these kind of things. The one person I did talk to, fucking hates me. So that's less than helpful. \n",
            "\n",
            "I guess I should just start off with what led to this. In 2008, I witnessed my best friends death. It's hard for someone to lose someone, it's harder when you see it actually happen. For the longest time afterwards, I was really fucked in the head. I would scream at my parents and tell them god awful things. I remember one night, my dad was drinking, like always. And he wouldn't listen to me. I took it out by destroying my room and flipping it upside down. I sat in the middle of my floor and pulled my hair out and screamed, and still...he didn't come to my aid. I then proceeded to go into the kitchen, and did the most dramatic thing I knew possible. I took a knife and put it to my wrists and demanded that he listen to me. But he didn't. So instead of cutting myself, I just threw the knife at the ground, ran into my room, slammed the door, and took a variation of different prescription medicines. After I was released from the hospital, I was ordered to go to a hospital for mentally disturbed children. I was there for about a month, and did absolutely nothing for me. The only thing it taught me was how to be more sneaky in hiding things from people. It taught me to surpress my memories and my feelings. I was able to hide from everyone including myself. And it worked...for awhile. \n",
            "\n",
            "Let's move things a little bit further into the future. After my friends death, I had a huge ordeal with my ex boyfriend. After that relationship ended, I literally had nobody. I learned how to be content being alone for so long. It was easy for me, almost. Moving things a little further...I met someone else. He was in a relationship at the time, and there was a lot of bullshit that came along with that. After about three years of them being together, they ended things. And it was my chance to be with him. We were together for almost a year, when I learned that I was pregnant. I ended up having an abortion, which I believe to be the reasoning behind all of...this.\n",
            "\n",
            "I've never felt a greater pain in my entire life, than the regret I have for that abortion. I didn't feel like this at first. But now I just feel empty. I don't even have anyone to talk to about it. This month would have been my due date even. Throughout the entire process of the abortion, I was practically alone. Mentally, at least. After that, my life started to go down hill...a lot. If affected me more than I expected it to. \n",
            "\n",
            "Now I find myself sitting outside in the middle of a field every single night with a pack of cigarettes that I end up going through within an hour. I sit there and I cry my fucking eyes out, sometimes I don't even do that. Sometimes I feel so numb that no matter how hard I try to release, nothing will come. I get really terrible thoughts all of the time. How easy it would be for me to just end things already. \n",
            "\n",
            "I'm not religious in any way. To me, if I die that's it. There's nothing waiting for me on the other side. I won't even know that I'm dead. I'll just be gone. Which doesn't sound all of that bad to me. How can I be hurt if my existence is gone? I don't have friends, and even if I did, I can't just talk to people that I know in real life about these kinds of things. Most people just say sorry, or in other words tell me to get over it. Some people will even flip the situation and make it about themselves, like it's a fucking contest and they're trying to one up me. \n",
            "There's a lot of other things that come into play here as well. I grew up without a father, he was in prison my entire life. But my mom had various boyfriends. A lot of them abused my brother, slapped him around, pushed him, called him names, anything you can think of really. I tried so hard to get them to take it out on me instead.

I got excited thinking it was going to be something amazing or a present or something. I dropped my bunny and hurriedly ran towards him. As cliche as this sounds, he asked if I wanted to play a game with him, and at the time I was around four or five, so I said yes. Long story short, this man repeatedly sexually abused me. Sometimes my brothers would even stand in the doorway and watch him. Like it was normal or something. \n",
            "\n",
            "A few years after that, my mom found a new boyfriend, instead of the boyfriend being the sexual abuser this time, it was my brothers. I don't even know if they even remember this or not. We went down to the lake like we did everyday to go fishing. But one day it was different. They decided they wanted to \"swim.\" But instead, they just got naked and told me that they wanted to play a game. They told me to act like a fish and pretend that their parts were the bate. So I did, I didn't know what else to do. They were my big brothers, I trusted them. But then it just gets cloudy, all I remember after that is waking up on in the woods next to the lake bruised and scratched, with my pants around my ankles. I remember running home and crying and wanting to tell my mommy about it. But I knew that she wouldn't believe me. And if I had something, I'd have to deal with my brothers later on. And I was terrified of them at this point. \n",
            "\n",
            "My mom did meet a nice guy finally at one point. This man ended up raising me, and he was always there for me. I was his little girl and that's all I knew. I didn't even know that I had a father in prison, I thought this man was my dad. I'm not really sure why, but I did. Until my brothers got mad at me in daycare and told me that he wasn't. I was absolutely crushed. I remember running up to him and crying and he didn't know what to say to me. \n",
            "Now, that man doesn't even talk to me. His girlfriend is more important than I am. Whenever something goes wrong with their relationship, the blame gets put on me. I was kicked out of his home and eventually I moved into my moms house again. I have nothing but bad memories when i'm around her. I love my mother to death, but she doesn't know the type of things that go through my head. I don't want her to. She's not the first person I really want to go to with anything. She trys to be there sometimes, but she never listens. \n",
            "\n",
            "Currently, I'm just haunted with so many childhood memories, and I don't know how to handle them anymore. Instead of dealing with them then, I pushed them off. And now that I'm older and can understand what actually happeend to me, I'm forced to deal with it. And all I want to do is go inside and take my mother's boyfriends gun and just take it to my fucking head. Even four years ago I wasn't as serious as killing myself as I am now. I want nothing more than for this pain to just go away already. And I'm tired of feeling like I have no one to turn to, I'm tired of feeling like this. I'm tired of crying my eyes out every night when no one can even hear me. I feel invisible. \n",

We chatted a little bit and that was it. When the door was opened, one of the owners and I went up to the second floor to see the rooms and she didn't come up with me. The owners didn't talk to her. They told us later that they thought we were a couple -- what I found weird because I'm very far from being good-looking and she's quite good-looking. Anyway, there wasn't a room available for her so she left. A week later, one of the owners said my new Colombian housemates (now saying housemates does feel right, but also it kinda doesn't? I mean, I'm going to live there but I'm not living there at the moment) had arrived and that they would do a pizza night to celebrate it. Guess who was there? The nice girl. We chatted quite a lot that night. We talked about many things. She showed me her Lula's sandals. I really liked her and now I find myself having a real crush for the first time in years.

I've gathered all my stuff up for school tomorrow, I've written a note on my phone, and I've had one last fight with my mom. Once school is over tomorrow, I'm planning on going to the busiest street near school, ( I go to school in the city) and just walk in front of a bus.  I'm not sad anymore, I think. Unless I really start to think about it, I don't cry. I'm not telling my girlfriend, she'll break down. And I actually had a therapist appointment tomorrow too, how ironic! Well, wish me luck~ EDIT: Yes I am still here, not feeling much better, though. To no one's surprise, I backed out at the last second. My therapist appointment was cancelled, I had no one to talk to about it. I'm sorry if I worried anyone with a late update. \n",

            "I'm sick and tired of this muffled pain that I've been going through. Years have been horrifying to me. It started during my 8th grade year. Years before that, I was a happy kid who had many friends and loved life. But during 8th grade, I took a huge drop, not even knowing what happened. I tried to be fair to everyone, but I was losing those who were close to me. Around Christmas Break of 8th grade, I became shut out socially. I was scared; I was experiencing too much in such a short time. That was when i first thought of it: suicide. I even thought that I was ridiculous, but thinking over it was what pulled me closer to that word. What was there worth living for if there was nobody to share it with? How would I even make it without support? I planned on killing myself around the New Year, but it never happened. I was scared of dying, and I didn't even know how I would do it. I continued through my 8th grade year, silently living in pain and suffering. But never would I have thought that it would get worse as high school came.\n",

High school was an extremely worse situation compared to my 8th grade year. During the beginning of 9th grade, I had an extremely hard time finding people that could put up with me. I had 3 or 4 friends that I made within the first 9 weeks of school. Notice that I used *had*. That's because word got around quick about how I was the \"depressed loner\" in all of my home town. I lost the majority of my \"friends\" because of that. My grades were dropping at the same rate that I was. I felt stupid, and I started believing what was said about me: \"loser\". \"waste of space\". \"emo\". \"imperfection\". I lived in silence. But the internet was my solace. The only place I could relate to, enjoy, etc. I could meet people that could actually stand me and not judge me. Every day after school, I would come home, shut my door, and spend the rest of the day on my laptop. However, this progressively made me worse. I became more prone to the words of people. I became hurt even quicker. I became extremely awkward, too. There was something I kept hearing about, called *selfharm*. A name that was short and to the point. I thought that I would never resort to it, but I caved in eventually. I started cutting myself around November of 2011. And to this day, I still do. It is my drug. \n",

And I felt like shit. Complete shit. I felt like it was all my fault, and I still do. My cutting got worse, and I started to not even care about covering up what I did to myself. I wanted people to know what I had been going through. That was a big mistake, because my parents never knew until 2012. I haven't told them anything that has went on in my life. But my dad hates me for self-harming, and my mom doesn't really care much anymore. When they found out, my parents got me tested and I was diagnosed with major depression, social anxiety, and general anxiety. I was on meds for all of them, but I soon stopped using them.

            "suicide - MarriageMy marriage of only 3 years has failed and it's 100% my fault. When I was 20 I married the single most amazing woman I've ever met. She was a solid 11/10 for me but I haven't treated her right since the day we got married. I've been so cold and distant to her. On the days I'm drowning in depression and anger I treat her like shit even though she does everything right for me. On the days I'm bearable she's upset that I treated her like shit for the past few days so I'm just trying to do damage control to make our marriage last for me, because I can't stand to lose her. We have a son together and I'm a sub-par father to him. I work such a crazy schedule that I sacrifice so much sleep to spend time with them but I'm so grumpy that my wife said she'd rather me be asleep then be like this. She recently said she didn't love me any more, but she's pregnant with our daughter so she feels trapped with me. She moved across the country twice and dealt with a deployment but I can't even show her love because I'm so selfish and miserable. My life insurance covers suicide so I've been thinking really hard about offing myself and saving her and my two kids the trouble of dealing with me. She would get enough money so she would be able to live comfortably for 5 or so years until she would have everything under control and be able to raise our kids and hopefully find a better father for them. They would all be so much better off without me that it makes me almost happy to think of them without me there. I love them all with everything in me, and I am so sorry to them . Thanks.\n",

I tried to talk to my dad tonight about my issues and it blew up in my face. He says that I blame everyone else for my problems (might be true) but it was a really nasty conversation. He said he is fed up. Pretty much just laid into me about coming to them when I’m crying and he doesn’t know how to help. He later sent me apology and I love you messages (he is a good person/father) but what he said really got to me. There has to be some truth behind it. I’ve had a serious depression issue for 4 years. I feel like there is no end to this problem in sight. Not sure what to do. I’ve been to therapy so many times, I’ve tried taking many different medications and nothing is helping. I guess I am looking for a wake up call but am having doubts that the hospital is the answer. Please any helpful tips would be immensely appreciated. \n",

I didn't want anyone to see me. But if I had just started working back then, I could have had all of my surgeries right now. Instead, all I've gotten is this stupid breast augmentation which wasn't important at all.\n",

But sometimes they can't tell at all, or guys tell me I'm hot, one time there was even a girl who was interested in me without knowing I was transgender. That was a nice experience. Probably the only nice experience I had. But I really don't understand how that stuff happened. I look in the mirror and I just see that guy again. \n",

I don't mean romantically, I mean that I will never be considered a real woman now, because the strong women who live here do not see me that way. And they're right about me. I wish I was one of them. I'd have really been able to help people.\n",

Most of the women here say that they support victims of trauma, but I never got support. It's my fault for lashing out and not getting surgeries faster to improve my mood. Even my family doesn't like me, maybe if I hadn't been bad, they would have supported me way more, like these trans kids who live in my town. All day I have flashbacks to the times when I was bad, and I'm paralyzed. There are probably hundreds of bad memories now, and they take up most of my day    \n",

I started talking from my highschool years up til now ( 7 years. ) There were 2 people in the waiting room so i knew i wouldn't take much time with my story because i kinda revised it to only tell him the important events. I started talking and talking and as i was going for the part i wanted to tell, he seemed bored and gave an indifferent irritated expression on his face and said : \" I'm waiting for the part where you tell me how you're feeling now \" i said : \" i wanna kill myself and i feel super worthless \" to which he replied \" that's what i want to hear so i can give a medince \" i told him i just wanted to talk and for someone to hear. As he was writing the prescription i continue to talk and all he replied was with  Aha, oh, okey.. Humm, i see. When he finished in the middle of my talking he went directly to the door and said to take this medicine seriously. I was perplexed and understand that my time was up (about 20 mints) and walked me to the secretary where he told me to see another doctor if I don't want medicine, and i went out. This doctor has reputation ngl, but all i wanted was for him to listen not just give me a prescription not like I'm some kind of a canned food in a factory and him the irritated worker. It tells you alot about society who cures symptoms and not the disease itself, it tells you so much how society doesn't give a flying F to the helpless.

Again, it isn't a desire, and I know I won't do it, but combined with the identity stuff, I am a bit worried, and would love to hear if there are any people with similar experiences. \n",

I am in my late 20's and most people this age are married, getting engaged, etc. I am stuck a stage behind these peers, it is a sinking feeling. I have a challenging time relating with people, and have never had a boyfriend (which is quite bizarre at my age, I'm aware). I am a shy person and do not know if I will ever find a friend in this, much less a partner and am over all of this. What is the point of going on? I do not relate to other people, I will always be the weirdo and odd one out. There is not a point to living if you have no one to enjoy life with.\n",

            "suicide - my parents yelled at me for self harming, i’ve been feeling empty since or really anxious. i want to kill my self, i don’t want to do this shit anymore.i’m feeling so suicidal. it was around 4-5 days ago, i took half a bar of xan. i was hella loopy and shit and got really depressed. the night before i made a pretty bad cut and i wanted to go deeper. i stumbled for my box cutter and cut, i reached fat. i was bleeding a lot but i wasn’t panicking. i put gauze and wrapped it up rly tight. i called my friend for around 11 minutes and all i remember was saying “i’m gonna die” over and over again. i vividly remember his disappointed yet calm voice saying, “you’re not going to die” idk how but i hung up. i don’t remember much after but i know i took the other half and blacked out with no other memory of what happened. i have videos of me on snap talking to myself saying shit like “i don’t have any real friends”. when i woke up my head was killing me and my cut was still bleeding w yellow shit coming out of it too. i was really worried of infection. the night before my dad saw my cut and just put triple anti biotic and medical tape on it. so that’s what i did for 3 days. i told some online friends and they were really worried, especially my boyfriend. they all were telling me to go to my parents and get stitches but i didn’t have enough strength to the first day. the 3 days passed and i was getting worried, yellow shit was still coming out of it and i got paranoid it was infected. so i told my older sister, who’s 17. she was really worried when she saw it and she made jokes about it that kind of made me feel better but hurt sometimes. she decided the best thing was to get my parents. i was panicking and didn’t want to do i got her to get them downstairs. they asked if i did it to myself. i said yes. they began yelling at me, fueled with anger. my dad was squeezing my arm and touching my cuts that hurt like hell. my mom was the most angry. i held back tears but their yelling is what made me cry. she was cursing at me, making me feel like shit for waking them up. it’s all a blur really but i remember saying “i just feel like a burden”, my mom laughed and said i was being dramatic and kept saying omg. that’s how i felt though, like a weight being dragged around, constantly needing help that i don’t ask for. my mom made me sleep in her room, my dad on the couch like always. i begged to just sleep on the couch or in my sisters room but she just said no, which i understand. i couldn’t sleep that night, her room, even in our old house, makes me uneasy, i’m wide awake. my insomnia didn’t help either. my dad took my phone, i was grounded from seeing my friends, my room, etc. i just wanted a hug, support from them. but what did i expect. my parents have always been abusive, idk why i didn’t guess they’d make me feel even shittier. to make matters worse both my psychiatrist and therapist just moved, so no more of that. my pills have been needing refills for weeks, but it never happened. they never took my depression seriously. i’ve been diagnosed with depression, anxiety, ocd, add, an insomnia. i withdrawal from my meds and drugs like weed and xan. the next morning i woke up early, like 7 early. i spent the day watching the office, i just wanted to laugh. my mom of course got angry but didn’t do much about it. i changed my bandaids on my own, my parents didn’t bother with it too much, even though it was at an extreme risk of infection. i asked friends and strangers if it looked infected and read how to keep it clean. there was still puss coming out which wasn’t normal, i asked my mom but she blew it off. i didn’t know what to do but keep cleaning it. i slept in my sisters room that night. the next day my day had bought spray on liquid bandage that i’ve never heard of. (i found out later it should be used for minor cuts) he sprayed it inside of the cut, i have a high pain tolerance but i almost cried. he kept pinching my cuts, i told him i could do it but he kept denying it. i put on more medical tape and it hurt all day. i regret telling them, so much. my friend recommended calling suicide hotline to get cps involved, but i couldn’t do that to my younger sister. so i never did. ive been feeling pretty empty, even right now. my cuts have healed pretty well, but my mind has blocked out a lot of the memory of what happened. my friend, the one i called the night of, told me yesterday “you know you said something the night u made that cut that really stuck with me you said you weren’t even scared or anxious you just did it cause it felt so good is that true” i was shocked at that. i didn’t know what to say, i knew it was true but i didn’t want it to be. i told my boyfriend and he was really scared. he told me “imagine how scary it is for me trying to have a life w you and not knowing if i can cos idk if youll be alive” i felt awful. the first deep cut i did i told him, he was focused on how he felt and how much i hurt him. it sucked but we’ve gotten through it. don’t get me wrong, he’s absolutely amazing and everything i could ask for, i know how hard it is to handle something like this. i’m paranoid a lot he’s going to find someone better, or he’s lying that he loves me, he’s always reassuring me though. i feel bad for having so many problems he has to deal with. i’ve been feeling the urge to cut and do xan more and more, i haven’t though, i’m trying to get through it. i feel hopeless and constantly tired all the time. i wish to be dead at times, wishing i could disappear. the times i’ve tried killing myself and fail i feel like i can’t do anything right. i cant wait to move out of my house. i want this all to be over. i’m so scared constantly. i feel like no one cares and no ones going to read this. if you did, thank you for sticking to the end, it means a lot.\n",

I feel like I never can get out of my fucking house. I feel, like ending it. Since of being in position of a fishing pocket knife about 7 months ago in 7th grade, all my friends left me... I am a social outcast, and I get bullied of bringing that knife. I will regret for the rest of my life. I am so afraid to go to school in 8th grade... I am very afraid. Every day I wake up, splash my face with cool water, and look at my door hanger for towels and thinking raping my belt around my throat and putting a hook on it and putting a chair below the door hanger and kicking the chair while standing on it and plop down killing myself. But, as of now, that was nearly 8 months ago and I seem that I infer that everyone will forget that 7th grade moment. I watch you tube videos on \"suicide\" and I am just so sad, and just want to suck out all the pain out my life. I don't really know how. But I am ending it if I get bullied in 8th grade, and getting made fun of, and not having relationships, etc... This past year I am having such a hard time... I don't know what to do anymore, I hate this feeling. I want to get rid of it.\n",

That's when i knew I had to make my move, so i asked her to go to the movies with me and she said yes! We had a great time and held hands at the cinema, we both blushed a lot.

All through high school I utilized the school mental health counselor. I didn’t start getting consistent metal health treatment til ‘08. I have experienced an immense amount of trauma in varying degrees throughout my 39 years. I’ve been in the BSU 5 times now. I told my husband and a few close people that they didn’t have to worry about an attempt until I found a way that was 100%. I don’t want it to be a botched job with me ending up physically impaired and alive.  Well I finally found my way out and how I’d do it. Right now I’m trying to find a good enough reason not to. A conversation with my father yesterday, made it quite clear that a healthy adult relationship with he and my mother is impossible. I have worked and worked and worked at trying to manage my mental health. There have been times where I’ve seen three separate people in a month. I take my meds like I’m supposed to, I use a variety of healthy coping mechanisms.  It just doesn’t seem to matter to most of my family and my husband’s. I’ve been on disability since I was 31 and that cripples me financially. We are stuck in a house we can’t get out of because my husband doesn’t make enough to get us in a better situation. I very desperately want to move to the other side of the country, but my husband laid out all the reasons it’s impossible.   As I said, now I’m just trying to find good enough reasons, or a drastic change that could help my situation. If I can’t, then I’ll start my plan.\n",

As her daughter, living in another state, I would have conversations with her on the phone, most of which were her being really drunk and I would tell her positive things about her life to be happy about and to reflect on. I, myself, struggle with depression so I’ve been telling her to get help from a professional because obviously I’m not a pro and usually what I say to her is forgotten the next day.  It’s been tough since her attempt as my dad is asking for a divorce, my brother moved away with his girlfriend and I’ve been living away for some years now. But years before her attempt, we have been asking her to get help.  Now six months later she’s still at home, constantly drinking the day away and chain smoking in the backyard with her self damaging thoughts and no matter how much I try to encourage her or ask, even plead for her getting help, it’s not happening. I know addiction and depression cannot be solved overnight and has taken some individuals years to fully recover but I’m just looking for the first step for her. Or at least to direct her.  However, we can’t help her if she can’t help herself and I don’t know what to do at this point. \n",

Even if it was joking a kidding, it hurt my confidence, not to add to it I had horrible acne on my face that made me a social outcast at school - I became more and more asocial day and year after year, eventually this year I began to evem start shaking when heading to school some days due to the social-anxiety I now experience. For the past 3 years I have been on-off dating a girl that has cheated on me multiple times and has still always ran back, each time I've taken her back and been angry with myself for ever loving her. I'm a genuinely good person, actually highly intelligent too and I give to people even when I don't have enough for myself - always muttering under my breath cursing myself for being nice. I recently went to a football game for school and got a bunch of items with sugar in them just to try to help cope with stress or at least suppress it - this only lead to me having a freakout and almost passing out from the speed of my heartbeat.

I'm a 23 year old guy and I have no hope for my future, and I see no point in living. I was just dumped by my first love, we were together for a year and a half. After we broke up, I ended up moving back to my hometown about an hour away. She told me she wanted to \"work on herself\" and then I ended up finding out she cheated on me with a guy I was worried about, and is now in a relationship with a different guy I was worried about who she always called a douche bag and shit like that. They became Facebook official today, her family and MY friends commenting on the post. Little do they know, a month ago she was telling me she wanted to be with me forever. She lied to me, strung me along, and broke my fucking heart, and now she is telling her family, her friends, and my friends lies about me  and our relationship, calling me crazy, a stalker, and I don't know what to feel. I know nobody knows the truth except for me and her(like i said there is a lot more i can elaborate on). It sucks to be the victim and the bad guy somehow. I have no friends, and nobody cares about how I feel. Prior to this I had a pretty fucked up life, got a DUI when I was 20, which completely halted all of the \"dream\" jobs I've had permanently. I'm lost as fuck. I know I'm smart, I'm a good looking guy, I'm funny, but I have nothing. I have no path, I'm not close to finishing my degree, and I just feel like nobody cares about me, which sucks because I don't even care about myself. I'm pretty drunk right now, and I have a loaded Beretta 92 on my nightstand. I've been thinking about suicide a lot recently, but tonight it just seems like I really want to do it. I feel a weird sinking in my chest when I think about it. Please help me.\n",

            "suicide - Trying not to spiral outMy past year of life has been the roughest one ever, and at the age of 26 I am having a really hard time keeping my head up. I have ADD (diagnosed) and most likely depression (not diagnosed) and this past year has me spinning out hard. My highs are great, I beam happiness and inspire people around me, or so I am told. But my lows make me feel like there is no reason to keep continuing this life. In this year I have, failed out of school for the second time with no degree and 120k in debt. I lost my dog which was the only thing keeping me in contact with my parents about 3 months ago. I have no job and my girlfriend of 3 1/2 years just broke up with me over this past weekend citing that we are toxic to one another. I can see her side because I isolate myself from her and my friends and spend ~10 hours or more a day on my computer at my lowest points. I feel so disconnected from society that the only way that I actually feel good is when I am at a rave or festival fucked up. All of my actual friends live over an hour and a half away, and if I did decide to move back to where my parents live it would put them closer to three hours away. I also live with my ex-gf at this point and am not even sure about whether to just say fuck it and leave or to stay and push through. I feel like seeing her everyday is going to kill me inside knowing that we're not together, but at the same time just cutting ties and running as far away as I can will hurt the same. She has said to me that she would be down with the idea of us trying again at a later date, but I am not really a person who makes the same mistake twice so I almost don't even want to entertain that idea. My support systems feel like they are failing and I feel like any friends I have made at school are more my ex-gf's friends than actually my friends. I'm just trying to find meaning to my life because it feels like everything is crumpling away and I can't really see a reason to continue.\n",

So she said hey back and I have a class with her friend so she was like I know him (the girl doesn’t really know me I don’t her we ever had a class together and I’m quiet). So I was asking her and her fiend/sister some questions and I said ask me some also so they did. It went pretty well at least for me but now I’m starting to think about her like before I sleep and wake up and I don’t want another crush. One reason is because I don’t really see her so how can I talk to her another reason is I don’t think she knows what I look like and the most important reason is that I can’t talk to girls or anyone really. The same thing happens every time I have a crush, I like the girl I want to talk to her but I chicken out and if by some miracle I do, I make it kinda awkward and they don’t have interest and if I try dming I always get ignored or dry replies so I don’t want to do that. And because every time my crush is right there and I can talk to her but don’t or they seem really uninterested as far as not wanting to be friends it makes me sad, really sad and maybe even depressed and since all my crushes were like this I don’t like them.

As a kid, it was all about my birth giver staying in bed, hungover, getting drunk, making it clear the whole day was an inconvenience to her, so it never happened. From being 16 onwards my birthday was always spent with terrible boyfriends who thought my birthday would be a good day to rape or attack or abuse me or at the very least get drunk and tell me all the reasons their life would be better off without me but never leaving when I asked them to leave. My friends and family don’t bother with presents or cards or even calls or texts because over the years my birthgiver’s conditioning of them that I don’t mean anything and am not worth being kind to has worked, and this year I am 6 months pregnant, it’s my first year without my dad who died last year (the only person who ever made this day okay and who ever loved and protected me), and my partner thought today would be a good day to tell me that we haven’t in fact paid the right fees on our rented home and our landlord has put the house back on the market to let, evidenced by the sign that has appeared at our front door today. I went through a terrible episode of mental health when my dad died (the day after I found out I was pregnant), I have schizoaffective disorder and fell into a deep, suicidal depression. With the help of nobody else I climbed out of it, knowing that I had my child and that this was more important and things would get better. Things didn’t get better, and they never have or will. I can’t bring my baby into a world where we cannot afford to eat. I bought rope today from the hardware shop. I can’t fight this off any more, after recovery there were just more problems and pitfalls waiting for me. \n",

Me being already insecure about my face I am now going to have two huge more like four deep scars and does it look like an accident? Heck no. I made them into x's because I am the dumbest person ever. Anyways while I was at it my thighs, my stomach, arms, almost my neck, and now I am just in tears and so disappointed with what I have done to myself. I suffer with bipolar disorder/bipolar depression, many things really. Especially I am a schizophrenic. But my anger issues and my delusions of not knowing what is really fantasy is getting in the way of how I have been treating others. I am lashing out majorly where I have even wrote \"f\\*ck you\" on a piece of paper with my own blood and sent it to someone. I am not doing okay but all of those I have cared for are slowly hating me one by one because I can't control my emotions and I don't trust myself around anyone I feel if not myself I will seriously hurt someone. I have many times thought about doing it this week in hopes I will be happy. I will have a new life I might even change into something quite beautiful like a butterfly who knows. I just don't want to go down like this hated. But, I can't help it this blade isn't doing justice for me like it used to. I have passed out and just been feeling woozy but the relief really has left I now feel even more empty. I don't trust myself with myself. But how can I be alright if I can't even escape my own self. And everyday just a repeated skew of voices they sound so so real but everyone finds me crazy. \"JUST GO KILL URSELF ALREADY SMASH UR HEAD INTO THAT WALL SO HARD SO SO HARD\" and i do i hit myself over and over and i can't stop I WAS TOLD TO. I CANT FREAKING STOP.  I was told im a waste of time so now im also an unmedicated freak. I don't have much time left.\n",

            "non-suicide - 2nd time postingHi everyone. This is my second time posting and I’m honestly surprised I’m even here to make it. It’s my 20th birthday today. I have a severe case of strep throat. Today I woke up feeling better than I had in a few days. Less achy and sore. My mom was wonderful and make me my favorite breakfast and the Chiefs won. I still feel empty. I went to watch Netflix in the other room and my mom makes a comment about putting my dog down. I visit my grandma and grandpa because they’re my favorite people on earth. I help her write an email and I feel needed but still so empty. I love her. I stay so late at her house that I can’t make it to my home at college so I have to create an outfit for dinner in what I have at home and I don’t like it. I have to do my hair and makeup with what’s there too. I came home in a hurry after I got found out I was sick. My mom and dad leave before me to get a table at the restaurant for all of us. I’m running very late. I get in my car to find my gas light is on because, even though I just got it this week, there’s a problem and my dad needed to look at it. So my mom drove it to and from work and for any errands she needs. I have to fill it up at the scary gas station and get stared down by a scary man. But I’m not scared. I’m hoping he’ll do something bad. I drive all the way to my college town and pick up my two friends. One of whom is very sweet and says “oh I totally understand why you’re late” and the other continues to make comments about me being incapable of being on time to anything. We go to dinner and I try to talk but in crowds I shut down. Nothing I have to say is worth anything anyway. My friends talk more to each other than me. After we all leave my friends continue to talk to each other more and more. They even decide to take the dog on a walk without me because they’ve my throat hurts and I wouldn’t want to come. They yell up at me that I need to move my car for a neighbor and I leave. They do not text me. They do not call. They do not ask where I went or why I went there. I finally text one of them to explain and she responds with she’s sorry but she stays. I continue to explain and she continues to stay where she is. On my birthday with a friend I introduced her to. I finally explode in a long winded text about how it’s happened to me many times that I introduce friends and then get kicked out. I tell her that her “I love you” and her “I’m sorry” doesn’t mean anything because she’s still doing the thing she’s “sorry” for. I am now selfish because I don’t want them to hang out without me. I texted my mom about this. She hasn’t respond. All of this proves to me I have no one. My grandma couldn’t wait to talk about my cousins. Or my brother’s girlfriend. Or why don’t I have a boyfriend. I chose the restaurant because my friend is celiac and she can eat their food. But I am a doormat. I do not matter. I am empty. There are moments when a flame flickers inside me but not for long before someone or something puts it out. I am 20. I have fought for 20 years. I do not want to fight for 20 more. Or 10 more. Or even another day. I’ve made it to 20 and I can say it really doesn’t get better.\n",

And she cared for me and told me to get out. But I refused to listens because I saw the guy at the top make 15k in a week. So I yelled at her in rage. And I kept listening to these guys until about august, I am still working for them, and at this point I am homeless and living off the street, but the only thing that is keeping me going is maybe one day I will see her again and we might be again, in September I broke down and almost jumped off of a bridge, but I swear I could hear her. So I called someone and my father who I told to fuck off because I wanted to be rich in this job picks me up and takes me to his house. Now I am really close to being near her again but I don't want to cause her pain, she is with someone new and is moving on. But the more I come to accept reality the heavier I get the hard it is to move, the more I start to believe that it's impossible and the more I feel as though I failed every test I was given. I tried to move on in the past but, I can't not this one. She is where I went when it was the darkest, but the closer I get to crossing her path again and see that she moved on. The closer it's becoming easier for me to jump off a bridge. I am not seeing away out of it.

As far back as I can remember, I've been pretty sure that's the way I'd die. By my own hand. I suppose on my own terms. I told myself if I ever felt like I wasn't putting enough \"good\" into the world, that would be the day I do it. Humans over value life, and if mine isn't good enough I should just let go. I feel like I've hit a wall.\n",

Then they tried to keep it together, which was hell on earth. Eventually, she moved out and 5 hours away in the middle of the night. I was left to care for my dad and my younger siblings, and I don't blame her. It was brain cancer, so his memory was messed up, and it was just horribly antagonistic. He got worse and worse, the cancer spread, he lost the use of legs, he stopped being coherent, and eventually he passed. Three years ago today. My siblings eventually moved up by my mom and her new husband, because I was 19 and couldn;t afford house payments. I tried keeping college going, I tried keeping jobs, but everything falls apart.\n",

            "suicide - I’m ready to end my life right now.I just turned 20 and as of the last few weeks I’ve had serious thoughts of suicide. I’ve had thoughts of suicide before and going as far as leaving a suicide note, but had never acted on it. This is the first time I’ve felt compelled to post about this or tell anyone for that matter because the thoughts are getting worse by the day. My life isn’t horrible and I’ve been doing very well for myself since becoming an electrician and have had a solid group of friends for years. For some reason I feel an emptiness and my depression is getting worse. I’ve been having recurring nightmares of me dying in very traumatic ways and have been crying a lot. I don’t know what to do and I guess this is a last ditch effort of turning for help. The one thing that’s stopping me from committing suicide is thinking of my mother and knowing how she would react. She’s a recovering alcoholic who just got over a divorce with my father and has really gotten her life together since then. I don’t want to throw a wrench in her life and her having to grieve over her son who decided to be selfish and killed himself. I’ve been thinking about that a lot and my mom being the only reason I haven’t done it, but I’ve been justifying suicide more often than not now. I need serious help and don’t know who to turn to. \n",

            "suicide - I'm gonna commit by October 1stThe reason I have come to this conclusion is as stated in my last SuicideWatch post. My super mega plus ultra crush, Isaac, isn't dating anyone because (presumably) his girlfriend cheated or something. Anyway, this destroyed me and all my happiness. I was surviving on the fact that he could still say yes, so this news devastated me. So, I know all you guys are gonna say that I should just get over him or I'll be over him soon. But I start to doubt it more and more everyday, because my obsession just keeps growing and growing more and more and it's just horrible. I love him so much that I would give him everything if it meant just one day with him. If he heard that though, he would never want to talk to me again because he would be really creeped out. That's the one problem that was keeping us apart. He's creeped out by almost everything I do. I admit, I have done really creepy stuff to him in the past, so it's probably my fault that he felt/feels that way. But anyway, that one of the big reasons for me committing suicide. I have a few more, but those would make this thing too big, I'm only putting up my main reason. I say that I'm gonna do it by October, but I'll probably do it tonight or tomorrow. \n",
