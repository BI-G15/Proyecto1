I'm not sure if Australia has informed consent but it's virtually impossible to find someone here that will deal with me with the other mental health problems I have. So basically I can't even try E to see how I would feel on it. Might as well just forget about being who I am.\n",

I'm sick of it being called OCD or an addiction when it's not. It's a sexual preference. I didn't choose it. I don't want it. If I could reach into my brain &amp; carve the piece out responsible for it, I would. I sometimes hope I'll have a stroke, maybe that'll fuck me up enough to not think like this anymore.\n",

      "suicide - I don't think I should keep trying anymore.I've been feeling pretty good most of December. About 3 weeks ago my Dr increased one of my antidepressants and I was genuinely feeling GOOD after a few days. I was motivated, positive, and sleeping well. I was able to force myself to exercise. I joined a gym. I even picked up a new hobby - yoga! I was also eating really healthy. I was able to control my binge eating. I didn't eat anything bad at all the holiday parties I went to. I was proud of myself. I was feeling good about my body. I wore a skirt for Christmas Eve. Things were good. Not \"amazing\" but good. Content.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then right after Christmas the good feeling went away. I just felt sluggish and blah. But today, today it all came crashing down. I don't know if there was a trigger. I don't know if it has something to do with the fact that I started a new birth control pill 5 days ago. Maybe I'm getting sick after being around a bunch of sick people for Christmas. I don't know. Does it even really matter? I had a taste of what it felt like to feel \"okay\" and now it's gone. I feel like a shell. I'm 28, unmarried, poor, ugly, and aging. I hate the way I look. I'm not overweight but I'm covered in cellulite. I'm pale as fuck, and not in the pretty way. My hair is frizzy and disgusting and my face has wrinkles and is losing it's shape. The women in my family don't age well. I'm not going to be an exception. I'm past my prime. What's the point in continuing on? I have so much shame in the way I look.\n",
      "\n",
      "I really liked doing yoga. Until I decided to record myself. I can't afford a class, so I wanted to record myself doing the poses to make sure I was doing them correctly. What I saw made me want to vomit. I'm so disgusting. I'll never be a feminine, beautiful, graceful woman. I'll always be awkward and clunky and flabby.\n",
      "\n",
      "I realize this all sounds superficial. But I think it was seeing my appearance that triggered me. But it's not just my appearance. It's everything about me. I have no friends. No social life. No hobbies. Nothing that makes me interesting or cool. And I don't even care. I don't care enough to make friends. Or a hobby. Nothing sounds good to me. I can't find pleasure anywhere. Nothing feels like it has a point.\n",

      "3️⃣. Try not to fit in with the ordinary- there are a lot of people who do crazy things just to stand out, there's no need to do something drastic, try to stand out by being better than your peers,be it in academics or sports....and try to think what is different about me,then act on the points about yourself that you think are different from the others.\n",

Consider yourself superior- this is an unpopular opinion but hear me out ,you should have a few points about you that are unusual or different than the norm,be proud of them...you may appear as slightly arrogant but,treat everyone with kindness(no joke or cheesy line intended) help everyone you know  in small or big ways, it's all up to you.\n",

      "suicide - My messageJust a reminder to myself that I did all I could to cure my depression. No matter what I do I always feel the same way and experience the same psychological pain. I had a depression since I was 14 and I am 21 now. I can't do anything to feel happy or normal. I tried physical activity, medication and therapy but none of these things seem to work for me. I am just too tired and too sad about all the pain and the best decision that I see is to end it all. I don't think that anything can change and all I do now is experiencing more and more pain. I don’t have a job and any kind of hobby or interests. Everyday feels like the same and every night I go to bed with hope that this night will be the last one for me. I did all I could do and I have no hope left in me. What is life without any hope? It is just plain unending misery. I was thinking about ending it all and only now, I can say that I am ready to do it. There is nothing left that I can do or try and there is no hope no matter what I do. My life will be miserable and I will not be able to connect with anyone. I will try to improve something until the end of this month but I really want to end all the pain and suffering now. Even complete emptiness and darkness is better than waking up every day with false hopes that this day will be better than the last one. It will not be better it will only get worse. I have a plan that I can use to end it all and I feel that I should have ended it all when I was 14.I achieved nothing but pain and misery. I never had SO or friends and I am too afraid of meeting anyone. I have no friends so I will affect even less people than a normal person would. In the end, I can say that I am happy that all of you continue your struggle everyday but I lost my hope for recovery and this may be the end of the journey for me. Nobody knows about my thoughts so I will just wait for a time when I will be completely alone and do it.\n",

He says I’m the ideal boyfriend, that I do so much for him, but in reality I do the bare minimum; I put the dishes up he says, I scratch his back and head when he needs it he says, I make him laugh until his ribs hurt he says, I take care of our frog he says. But that barely feels like anything. I’ve known him for a year and half now, we’ve been together for just a couple of months, and I’m obsessed with him. But I get sad so easy, and so does he sometimes, but I cry and I go sit in the bathroom for 30 minutes at a time when I’m upset as to avoid upsetting him. For some reason it still feels selfish. I feel like I’m the reason he has to take antidepressants, anti-anxiety meds, everything. I feel like I’m the sole reason everything in his life turns bad sometimes and I don’t know what to do about it. I’m his boyfriend. I shouldn’t be so sad all the time and just drag him down all the time. All I should do is make him happy, I wanna make this last and it honestly feels like it really could! I know it will. But if I end up killing myself it won’t. I don’t want to hurt him but either way it feels like I am.\n",

Now everyone hates me. I’m the bad guy in at least two people’s stories. Then my ex shows up after a year and a half and asks for a hoodie I haven’t seen in a year. Where’s my dead brother’s hoodie that I let you borrow? Where’s my 60 bucks I gave to help you out all that time ago? Why would you randomly show up to my house with a dude I don’t know and ask for that? That still swirls in my head and it’s been months. I just don’t want to remember these people anymore, but I hurt them, so why am I so angry? I feel like I kinda deserve to remember everything I did, making people feel pain.\n",

I love him more than I’ve ever loved anyone or anything in the world and I just want to make him smile, hear his laugh. I tickle him incessantly sometimes just to hear him giggle, my favorite sound.

In the last recent months so many things have happened that have changed my entire perspective of how I feel day to day. I wanna start with my main area of anxiety, my ex. We had a great fucking relationship for four months and I cared about her and loved her. It was great. She tells me in December she doesn’t really want a relationship at the moment and she wants to be friends still. She gets mad at me every time I try to exit and reach out. And because she left me with so many unanswered questions I can’t go without asking her sometimes. I am an emotional guy and she knows this about me, but it didn’t seem she cared. I know she told me it’s nothing to do with me it’s just the fact she doesn’t want a relationship. Tonight I learn that she never really found me attractive (she did for first two weeks then she felt bad) , she thought I was weird and that I she felt obligated to say she loved me cause she didn’t want me to feel like she didn’t. School has been nothing but added work to the stress and intrusive thoughts I have going through my head all the time. None of my friends or really, family listen to me much because I’ve never had mental health issues in the past. There’s more but I don’t want to type it all out because I don’t really have the motivation to do so. I’m out of carrots, I’m out of sticks. I have no idea where to go from here, because for the first time in my life, I don’t see where it gets better, and I want to go to sleep and never wake up. IM NOT SUICIDAL. I don’t want to die, but I don’t want to live if it’s gonna stay like this.\n",

None of you are even grateful!\" I stopped my game as soon as I heard that and looked at her. \"I clean every single fucking day and this is how you treat me?!\" she hollered.

After that I had an ortho appointment, I was expecting to finally get my braces off but no a son of a bitch gap appeared and now I have two power thingys. After that my dad and siblings picked me up, I saw a Maserati Ghilibi on the road today and later I learned my family saw a newer ACURA NSX on the road, to bad there was no picture. We later got home and I took my Camry for a spin, it’s been sitting in the garage for two weeks until today. I pulled it out and cleaned the seats, then I found some sticky shit I’ve never seen before in the back seat cup holders. This pissed me off because I’ve never broughten any candy or sweets in my car EVER, so I spent 15 minutes cleaning that mess. After that I drove my baby with the moon roof down the neighborhood twice. My second lap around I think I pissed off a Karen because this lady was looking at me pissed off. I later got back home and ate dinner. I ate chicken soup because my braces were starting to hurt then I studied some more for my math exam tomorrow and then worked out. I did a 5 minute warm up, 20 minute total body and 10 minute upper body work out video. I also did 20 pull ups and 50 pushups today. After all that I showered and watched some top gear then went to bed. Now I wake up an hour later feeling VERY hot and then I try to go back to bed but have no success. \n",

My best isn't good enough for them, and it will never be. Not only my parents, but some people at my school are very rude to me as well. I get picked on for being ugly, and I already know I'm ugly, they don't need to point it out. Other than that I just feel trapped and lost. It feels like there's no hope anymore. If I tell my parents I want to die they wouldn't care. How do I know? I asked them, guess what their response was. \"So?\" I cried my self to sleep that night, knowing my parents didn't even care. I had no friends, my parents hated me and I was just depressed. I want to die, but I'm too scared. I'm scared of the pain of dying. I don't want to suffer any longer but if I die, it'll hurt in more ways then just emotionally. This went on for 5 years. At least I gained one friend, her name I can't point out because of privacy reasons but she is the best. Whenever I go to school it feels like I'm happy again when I'm hanging out with her, and that made it harder for me to commit suicide. If I died, how would she feel? I don't want her to be sad. I've started to cut myself, but I've been clean for about 3 months. Please, if anyone will spare the time to talk with me, please do... I'm still very lost..I want to make new friends...

It sounds bad but my family caring just makes me feel more trapped in life. I'm being forced to live at this point. Gonna go into inpatient soon probably so if that doesn't end up helping at all I might just say fuck it and do it anyway cause that feels like basically my last chance to turn things around\n",

      "suicide - My girlfriend committed suicide last year. It has been very hard to not follow in her steps, and I am afraid I will tonight.I have been trying for so long to stay alive and fight my suicidal impulses. My girlfriend of 3.5 years committed suicide in April of 2018. My best friend for many years drugged and raped me in 2017. I have been fired as a result of calling the police when the cook at my job assaulted me (he was arrested). My father has shown his true colors as a textbook narcissist and has abandoned my family. I've dealt with Bipolar disorder (type II) for as long as I can remember. Shortly before my girlfriend passed, the work of Albert Camus cured the suicidal impulses I had been dealing with for many years. The Myth of Sisyphus in particular, a reason to live is just as good a reason to die, and vice versa. When my girlfriend shot herself a few weeks later, my resolve to never commit suicide was solidified through my understanding the impact her action had on her family, me, my family, the list goes on. However, after months of heartache, I started feeling suicidal again. It has only gotten worse. I have grown so disconnected and dissociated from my surroundings. I can think of killing myself and the effect it would have on my family, my girlfriend's mother (whom I am very close with), my friends, and more people than I can comprehend. But when I think of this, and think of the pain I will force people to endure because of my selfishness, my desire to die is unaffected. I bought a green cheek conure in August 2018 and she was shipped to me in September. I did this because when I thought of the effect my suicide would have on a bird that is obsessed with me, I actually cried. It was the first time I had felt human in weeks. I love this bird. Her name is Kiwi. Sadly, I am no longer affected that way when thinking of leaving her. I want to join my girlfriend. I miss her so much. I'm sorry Kiwi. \n",
      "\n",
      "I have not told anyone close to me my choice to end my life tonight. I could never plague them with the thought that they could have stopped me, no matter how much I want to talk to someone about it. I am selfless enough to realize that. I am posting here because I have nowhere else. I used to be scared of committing suicide. But these past few days, I have been craving it. I recently rolled my car and (some have said) miraculously survived with few injuries. I no longer have reliable transportation to college. I am still technically in high school, however, I have finished early and rather than graduating early, I am taking advantage of a state program that allows high schoolers with good grades to go to college early. I am a junior in high school, though I haven't had a high school class since summer 2018. The crash is a turning event, as I no longer have the freedom to do what previously made my life worth living: succeed academically early and actually have something to work for. I feel hopeless. \n",

      "I used to ponder my girlfriend's decision and question her motives and never be able to find an answer. Now, over these past few weeks, I can confidently say I understand her actions and I can sympathize with her. It's eerie and morbid, but it makes me confident in my feelings.\n",

I don't expect for them or anyone to sympathize with or understand me completely. I am aware of how selfish I am. I am flawed, and I am broken. I am done, and I look forward to joining my girlfriend on the other side.\n",
      "suicide - Something's Different This TimeI've battled suicide ideation since I was 9, I'm 36 now.  I hate myself so much that I hit my face, as hard as I can.  I live alone and have no friends.  I used to, when I was younger, but my anger flared up eventually and I've lost them all.  I can't call the suicide hotline. I did last night and had to talk him out of a welfare check.  Last time the police came 5 of them surrounded me, put me in the back of a cop car in front of my daughter and took me to the hospital where I was then released in an hour.  The cop followed me to the bathroom and wouldn't leave the hospital, it really felt like he was waiting for a chance to arrest me. \n",

One had the 72 hour put on me and I was escorted by armed guards on a commercial flight to anchorage in front of all the other passengers.  It was mortifying and I would have happily went.  The DMHP was cold and mean and put in my chart that I constantly berate my daughter, which is one bad thing I don't do.  He never spoke to me about my daughter and I think was just pissed I couldn't talk to him, thinking it was a choice. \n",
      "\n",
      "The hotline asked if I had tried to get help from the two behavioral centers where I live.  I had to tell him that one of them assigned a male therapist going through a divorce that tried to have sex with me.  I tried reporting him to his facility before he got really bad and they told me to give him a compliment sandwich.  So I reported him to the other facility and now they won't see me.  \n",

      "suicide - I'm 26, male, virgin, never had a real relationship. Contemplating suicide, what should I do?When I was 3, I was diagnosed with autism because I constantly pinched the other students in my preschool class. Afterwards, I was immediately sent to a special ed school starting in Pre-K. From Pre-K to 3rd grade, I attended a special school for children with autism. The problem: I was significantly more socially adept than the other students, and thus ended up in a situation where I did not develop properly.\n",
      "\n",
      "At 8, due to years of being in the school with children whom I was much higher functioning than, my parents had me re-evaluated. As it turned out, I actually had ADHD, not autism. And that's when I started taking Ritalin. Problem is, the Ritalin gave me tardive dyskinesia, an illness which I still struggle with to this day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, due to my new diagnosis, I was transferred to a school for children with mild learning disabilities at the age of 9, for the 4th grade. Problem is, the damage had been done. My time at the autism school caused me to develop massive social issues, and my awkward tics caused by the Ritalin made me stand out. After years of being viciously bullied, I was transferred out of this school after the 6th grade, and developed massive trust and self-esteem issues due to this experience that continue to hold me back even to this day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Starting from 7th grade, I was transferred back to the autism school, where I would remain until graduation from high school. Much like before, I did not like being around my autistic peers; it was a depressing environment that honestly felt like being in a mental institution.\n",
      "\n",
      "After that, I went to university. I did not fit in, and often felt lost in the crowd. I had been far too damaged at this point to fit in with typical college students. I often avoided conversing with people, because I always felt like the best I'd get from them would be pity, and at worst, they'd hate me. I almost never talked to girls; as I knew I'd get nowhere considering my lack of experience. And the few times I did, I'd always say the wrong thing due to my nervousness.\n",
      "\n",
      "And now, I am 26. It has been over 4 years since I graduated university. And throughout my life, I have had nothing to show for it. I have gone insane to the point where I spend hours playing online games and even steal money from my parents in order to cope with my hopeless state of mind. But at this point, it's too late. I'm too inherently socially adept to relate with the autistic crowd on a mutually beneficial basis, but I'm also too damaged to relate to the typical crowd. There is nowhere for me to go; I'm already 26, so it would take a miracle for my situation to improve significantly. At this point, what option is there left for me other than ending my own life?\n",

My brother says it to this day, either while he’s gaming or just sometimes in conversation. I hate my family for not saying anything to him to try to get him to stop. I also hate myself for not trying hard enough to get him to stop. They just act like it’s normal that he says it. I would never ever say the word again but it doesn’t erase the fact that i have.

      "suicide - Looking for specific resources: what if your reason is because you are unable to find the right kind of person to have the right kind of relationship with? (I've already tried therapy)Psychotherapy can't actually find someone for you, and it isn't a replacement for real relationships. Some people talk about it helping you \"gain the skills,\" \"improve,\" etc. but it's just a bet, and perhaps a bad one. There's no guarantee you can become \"good enough,\" or that even if you are, that there will actually be the right kind of person available. When \"work on yourself\" is suggested to someone at risk for suicide, then it seems to me that the real motivation is to redirect that person to spend time working one some goal in an effort to at least delay suicide. If it works, great, if not, then it did enough anyway, since there are an infinite number of \"sub-goals\" for a suicidal person to try before suicide. Repeat it enough times and that person will eventually die from some other cause.\n",

Here's how you could test if a solution is good enough: would you be willing to go without the kind of relationship I know you know I'm talking about, forever? Is your alternative just as good? Are you indifferent between your alternative and that actual relationship? Are you living your actual life that way right now, and if you commit to living that way for the rest of your life?\n",

I'm so tired of crying myself to sleep every night. It's miserable just staying awake praying for someone to love me the way I want and to just care about me. I don't have the best heart, so I was planning on just taking the slow death route. I don't want someone to find me. I want to just get very sick to the point of no return. Then no one will blame themselves. I figured increasing my medication dosages, eating much less food, and the incredibly high amount of stress I have in my life on a daily basis I probably won't last too horribly long. Even if it takes a few months for my heart to finally give out. It's better than living the rest of my life in my mind. \n",

I think about it, usually after waking up in pain, or when I’ve had another irrational upset. Background on me is I am married, with a 6 month old child, and I’ve been on and off light work for the past 5 years. I’ve had a back surgery that either hasn’t worked as well as hoped for or I’m simply at the time frame of needing a repeat fusion. \n",

This was and often still is a method that I think about and have tried and yet whenever I look up if anyone else has thought of the same thing or has these same feelings I always find nothing. In order to make suicide look like an accident many turn to the ‘suicide by cop’ or stepping out in front of a vehicle. But in a society (at least where I live) where there is a lot of violence at street level there are people who are willing to kill you over a phone. It’s like some sort of painful euthanasia. So, whether I’ve got all my valuables on me, coming back from the gym with a bag full of sweaty clothes or on my way to the chicken shop with nothing but some coins, every time I’ve been accosted or attacked in some sort of attempted mugging or whatnot I’ve never handed anything over or backed down-To many on the outside this has seemed like some sort of bravado or ego related ordeal but in fact it was the best way I thought I could die without anyone thinking that I was going through anything. To this day (and thankfully, I guess) no one has fully gone through with it but I still think about this method at least once a day, and rather than steering clear of dangerous looking groups, locations and situations where there are people known to want to harm me I will travel through them on purpose- to the others a sign of bravery and boldness but to me I’m just really hoping someone else can take me out because I know I can’t.\n",

      "I am considered an above average looking guy, i have many friends, but i cannot find myself anybody who loves me back. With every girl, i either screwed up my chances, or get told that they only want me as a friend. I try to change myself for the better, but i feel like I'm a lost cause. I'm 19 and i have never been in a relationship and I feel like nobody wants me. I had one night stands before but there's a void inside me left by my previous attempts to find someone who loves me back, but i fall flat on my face. If i get close to a girl, i start to panic and mess up the whole thing. I fell in love many times, i fell on my face. My first love told me how good a friend i am , then the next day, she got together with my best friend. I'm good looking, i just don't possess the skills to get a girl, i am boring. This went on for years, but now i'm sick of it. All of my friends are in happy relationships, i'm jealous of all of them, while i'm still suffering by the loneliness i live with. I'm at that point in my life where i should get my stuff together, because my exams are close (similar to GCSEs) and i need to study because my future life depends on it, but i just can't. I'm worn out and i'm losing motivation, because i don't think i will be able to get in the university i want to go to.  I want to be a psychologist to help others, like me, but first i should get my shit together. I doubt if i can. I'm losing hope to live a normal life. I get no help from my family, my mother doesn't know about how i feel right now, but i'm afraid to let her know as i don't like her because how she treats me. I got little to no support from her, just criticism on every move i make. I basically grow up without my father, as he was working abroad, but now i'm not on the best terms with him either, he's a shitty human being. The pressure of my exams literally kill me, and my inability to find love makes me feel that all my dreams will crumble.  At this point i have no other goals in my life just to find someone who loves me but i seriously doubt if i ever will. I have incredibly high standards, that i tried to lower, but i couldn't. As I said I am quite good-looking i think a need a girl equally pretty, so i can't settle with anyone lower than me, (I know I'm a narcissistic piece of shit) but i can't get anyone who's fit to me, according to my standards, but i can't get anyone who is \"right for me\" as my confidence i highly unstable. Sometimes i'm confident, and sometimes i lose all of my confidence. I also have serious mood swings. I feel like i'm destined to be alone, and this feeling tears me apart. I'm slowly starting to lose interest in everything i have been interested in before, i am a hollow shell of what i had been before. I feel the only thing left for me in life is to hang myself or cut my wrists, i don't know what to do.\n",

      "non-suicide - Study shows that too much hw is harmful. Spread the word. A Stanford researcher found that students in high-achieving communities who spend too much time on homework experience more stress, physical health problems, a lack of balance and even alienation from society. More than two hours of homework a night may be counterproductive, according to the study.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Pope and her colleagues found that too much homework can diminish its effectiveness and even be counterproductive. They cite prior research indicating that homework benefits plateau at about two hours per night, and that 90 minutes to two and a half hours is optimal for high school.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Their study found that too much homework is associated with:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "• Greater stress: 56 percent of the students considered homework a primary source of stress, according to the survey data. Forty-three percent viewed tests as a primary stressor, while 33 percent put the pressure to get good grades in that category. Less than 1 percent of the students said homework was not a stressor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "• Reductions in health: In their open-ended answers, many students said their homework load led to sleep deprivation and other health problems. The researchers asked students whether they experienced health issues such as headaches, exhaustion, sleep deprivation, weight loss and stomach problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "• Less time for friends, family and extracurricular pursuits: Both the survey data and student responses indicate that spending too much time on homework meant that students were “not meeting their developmental needs or cultivating other critical life skills,” according to the researchers. Students were more likely to drop activities, not see friends or family, and not pursue hobbies they enjoy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The results offer empirical evidence that many students struggle to find balance between homework, extracurricular activities and social time, the researchers said. Many students felt forced or obligated to choose homework over developing other talents or skills.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, there was no relationship between the time spent on homework and how much the student enjoyed it. The research quoted students as saying they often do homework they see as “pointless” or “mindless” in order to keep their grades up.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“This kind of busy work, by its very nature, discourages learning and instead promotes doing homework simply to get points,” Pope said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "She said the research calls into question the value of assigning large amounts of homework in high-performing schools. Homework should not be simply assigned as a routine practice, she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Rather, any homework assigned should have a purpose and benefit, and it should be designed to cultivate learning and development,” wrote Pope.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

I'm 18 years old, a freshman in college, and it's not going well at all because I have no motivation to do anything. My insurance doesn't cover psychiatric care, i've been paying for therapy and everything out of pocket. I'm really tired of \"getting better\" then ending back up in the same spot: hopeless and lacking the will to do anything. Only thing holding me back is my boyfriend (who I cannot spend the holidays with) and a few friends, other than that I have nothing to live for. I stood at the beach two Saturdays ago standing and looking at the water for two hours really late at night, I wanted to go for a swim and just never return to shore, i inched closer and closer for a while, my shoes got wet but I didn't go in. I feel like i'm on autopilot at this point, I don't even remember what I did the last two weeks.

People are raped daily. I don't understand joy, and how someone could feel it while we live in a world so fucked up that we can't even take care of our fellow humans. And there's nothing I can do to change it. I just want out. Away from people. Where I don't have to constantly hear about the horrendous things that people do.

I have what I need. Why can’t I do it. There’s no point in living when I may have lost the only person that made me feel alive. The only person I really loved. My mind is fragmented.

I'm 18 now in a university, I've been feeling this way since the 7th grade. I've always just felt inferior to everyone else. I've always had horrible social anxiety and been very awkward, so ive always had trouble reaching out and making new friends, especially recently. I find that recently whenever I see any social interaction it just doesn't make sense to me, it just seems so surreal. I've been here on campus for a week longer than my roommate and i've made next to no real connections with anyone while it seems he has befriended the whole floor. I just don't understand how sociallity works. I find very little fun or funny anymore. Even with friends I'm usually just bored and i seldom provide anything mentally when im with them. I'm pretty sure at this point the only reason they'll still hang out with me is out of pity, im pretty sure thats the only reason anyone will talk to me. I have a group of friends who i used to hang out with and who ive hung out with again recently, i feel like i can be me around them but i don't want to bother them, they have better things to do. One on one situations i just can't do, i can't do enough to hold my end of any conversation, i prefer groups of 3 or more but then i can never get anything in. My roommate and his friends always invite me to do shit, which i appreciate even if it is out of pity, but i always have to decline just cause i know ill just sit there in silence and not contribute anything. \n",

I'm undeclared right now with no passion for anything, so even if i do go threw with all 4 years whatever i would choose wouldn't be a passion, it would be more of like a \"oh, this option is a bit more tolerable than the others\". I'm just wasting my parents money at this point, if it were my money i wouldn't give a shit but so much of my family has spent so much on me and i know i just can't live up.

This isn't even the lowest i've felt, but ive been down so long that im just done really. I just want to be free and not have to deal with anything anymore. \n",

But once middle school started i couldn't really make friends and I couldn't really do what I used to and just wait for someone to knock on my door wanting another for a game or what not. At the outside part of our lunch and lunch itself I just sat by myself and it was that way for a while. \"The cool kids\" would come sit with me at my table because I guess they thought it was funny. It was weird though because it happens so much that it became normal and I was almost a part of their group. They would never hang out with me or anything or really \"talk\" to me and I knew they didn't just tell me to fuck off because they still liked to make fun of me in those indirect ways. It was really all I had in terms of friends up until 7th grade then our district replanned and my nieghborhood started gif ng to the other middle school in town. Again I was back to having no one. I would try to talk to the few people who I thought would like me but after I while with no luck or just realising I was annoying them I would just go back to being a loner. \n",

High school is different than middle school and and even though I still don't have real friends I'm friendly with any one and everyone even if i only talk to them because we are paired by a teacher. So that's good I guess. Its pretty much how high school has gone. The last two years have been good because my brother has invited me to hang out with his friends a couple of times. I loved those moments so much because it actually felt like I had friends and I was doing stuff that I should. Even if I know they are doing the indirect making fun of me. At time I still feel like they like me. That was really only the summer before junior year because my brother is two year ahead of me and they're all at college now. Though it still happened once or twice this year. This past summer we volunteer at a camp as counselors at it really feels like friends they're with all the counselors my age and older. After the week was done my brother invited me to come to a party type thing with some of the cool counselors. The guys really were the cool \"alpha\" type and the girls were the gorgeous popular type and these were exactly the kinda people I want to be like. Again I know they still kinda think of me like a charity case and do the indirect making fun of me but I still felt like they like me.

I've experience people not wanting to sit near me or hold my hand when we had to do square dancing in gym class. Its why I try my best to take care of myself and try to be as normal as possible, even if it still hasn't helped. It has helped me in that I know and accept that people don't want to be my friend almost so I can make the best of it and be acquaintances with everybody like I said.

I have up on trying to communicate and then it seemed to be me who would shrug him off when ever he would try talking to me. It hurts the most when he talks to the dogs more than me of if the first words in months come because we're at thanksgiving with family and we all just act like everything is fine and were a good family.this past year everything he does annoys me. I get madder and madder each and every day and I just want to shout at him and tell him off. I never can and the only relief I've gotten was when At the start of 2016 he went down to do border patrol for 3 months.

I tried to go to school but I couldn't take the fear and anxiety past the first two days. I've told my mom only about the anxiety and even my psychiatrist and therapist up until I turned 18 in December. I was finally ready to tell someone and they helped me realise it wasn't physchotic or crazy or bad but was called depersonalization. But that was it. I feel like they haven't been any help and have not given any advice on the episodes since I told them about it and seem to ignore it and still focus on my anxiety.

People are all selfish and had all sorts of bad qualities in their nature, such as cheating, bullying the weaker people (usually women) in the family.

The other day he hung himself and was cut down in time to still be alive and know is facetimibg her pictures of ropes saying if she doesn't come back he will do it again. I do get that this is very hard for her and makes it feel like it's her fault, bit when she goes back to where she's from i know she will fall back into using and he will not let her leave.

I have bills and bills stacked up of therapist that were awful to me but stuck with me for a check. Some of them were so done with me but they stayed for a paycheck. That's what they do, waste your time and money and lie and tell you there is hope. They will never tell you to your face that they have no clue how to help you. They will just keep taking a check until you quit so they can be on some \"she gave up on herself\" Bs so they don't have to hold themselves accountable for the bare minimum they gave me. Plus the micro aggression all racism and how most therapist do not take black patients into as much consideration as there white ones. A lot less remorse a lot less patients a lot less willing to really dig in the root of the problem. Being black and mentally unstable... My whole fucking life the world has never been on my side.

      "suicide - Life bores me.I’ve struggled with severe depression and anxiety since I was about 10 years old. I’ve tried different varieties of pills, I’ve had appointments with professionals and been in different treatment programs. Amidst all of this I’ve attempted suicide three times. That aside; I’ve tried my best to distract myself in ways such as hanging out with friends, hobbies... you get the idea. Long story short - I’ve literally tried anything within range to help myself get better. Nothing has helped in the long run thus far and it has only gotten worse.\n",
      "During these years I’ve done my best to conclude the whys, the whats and the whens. At first I believed it was the passing of my father that caused it all, and maybe even my childhood, but lately I’ve been starting to believe that neither two are a core reason at all. You see, ever since my teenage years I’ve always felt incomplete, unhappy, unfulfilled and like I’m not the main character in my own life. An outcast. Only a stepping stone for all the people that have walked in and out of my life - a bottomless resource you might even call it. In a way this’ll perhaps sound contradicting but I’ve always prioritised other people and their wellbeing as a way to distract myself from my own, because it always made me feel good when my friends and family were happy. A temporary bliss, sort of. Other than that I’ve tried to fill this hollowness inside of me with the love of former boyfriends. Hasn’t led anywhere, obviously. Sadly I’m at a point in life now where not even the wellbeing of my friends and family is a good enough reason to stay. Metaphorically speaking - my life is like the roots of a big tree. See, the roots represent different paths in my life, but they all lead to the same source. The base of the tree. No matter what I do, what path I take, I will always end up in the same place.\n",
      "As I said; I’ve done my best to conclude and I’ve indeed concluded. This life is not for me. I’ve come to realisation that in this world of concrete, I will never feel complete or fulfilled. I will never feel happy, because strictly speaking - life bores me. And finally being able to be honest with myself after such a long time of struggles and denial truly has such a liberating and calming effect on me. I’m done carrying this weight on my shoulders, I’m done pretending and I’m done going the opposite direction of a one-way road. I don’t want to live, and why force myself to do something I don’t want to do? I’m sorry but I give in.\n",

Mother just makes excuses and says he's just walking around his apartment.. Sure, he is.. He's always walking around.. in the same spot as me at the same time every day.. Just the other day, I walked too fast for him and I sat on the couch and he wasn't quiet enough so I heard him slowly walking across the floor upstairs as if he was trying to be quiet so I couldn't hear him.. He tries to quietly follow me and then he stomps his foot to try to scare me..

At the age of 18, I was rejected. So i went to a 2 year college with the intent to transfer in because I just couldnt imagine myself at any other university. During my time at this 2 year university, i went thriugh massive spouts of depression and suicidal thoughts.\n",

      " The only thing that pushed me through it was studying in the library of my dream school pretending to be a student there telling myself that it will one day be worth it. After i sent in my application, i literally walked around the campus for a few days just to see what it would be like to be a student there and look at the beauty of the campus. I even started to believe in god a year before applying and prayed all the time to make it into this school. I volunteered, worked many different jobs and worked my ass off the become the president of 3 clubs to try and polish my application. I spent a year writing the personal statement getting everything perfect and was in near tears when i submitted it.\n",

      "Today was great. I slept through my Chemistry class (starts at 1pm), Didn't eat anything today except for a chocolate twinky, two kit kats, 5 Hershy's chocolates, and a basket of cheese fries. But it's okay, this is how it's been since my 3 year old daughter died in April. I don't care about what I eat or how I'm 240 lbs all the sudden... but then again, I do. It makes me hate myself even more. Got my license renewed yesterday and man did I look like a chubby piece of shit. My pregnant wife has been too sick to work, in fact she has to get IV injections daily at the hospital for it.  I'm taking 17 credit hours with four science classes so I'm too busy to pick up more than my one shift a week. 17 credit hours of school we had to pay for out of pocket since my GPA is too low to qualify for any financial aid. So yeah, we're broke. \n",

Its my fault she still has to work that crappy McDonald's job she's been at since High School, even while pregnant. It's my fault she's giving up on me. It would be better if I weren't even here.

Now that she's gone, it's haunting the hell out of me that I've screwed up mine and my wife's life being a lazy, selfish brat. A father/husband is supposed to provide for his family and I can't even do that right. She'd be better off with someone else who can actually take care of her, and I'd be better off dead.\n",

The only thing that has slightly returned is my appetite and that’s it, I’m just as anxious as before and now I’m on even ore medication. Valium Seroquel zimovane propranolol and I barely make it through a day without trying to harm or kill myself. I have no quality of life I go nowhere I mostly just hide under my duvet from everyone cause I’m scared I will hurt them. I am get  agitated through most of the day v forgetful and get quite confused. I don’t even say the same things I used to anymore I don’t speak with any confidence or clearly. I can’t even bare to look in the mirror and I have a wall of mirrors on wardrobe doors so I have to open one and so I don’t see myself. I am triggered by almost everything I get Scared by words in conversations words, on paper, I feel terrified even standing outside sometimes I don’t even go downstairs I’m terrified of who I am and who I’m becoming I’m literally so scared of even leaving my room or hearing people in the house my anxiety and depression is literally ruling my whole life I don’t know how to cope any more I don’t feel like used to and everyone keeps telling me it will get better but it hasn’t it only feels worse. The Seroquel is horrible the feeling is too intense and I don’t like it at all but I don’t know what else to do aside from the obvious. I’m trapped in this house so I can’t run and kill myself if I jump out the window I likely won’t die and I’ve tried hanging numerous times but the sensation and the pain in my neck and throat is too much for me to bare. I’m literally trapped in my mind my home and in this life I have a family a daughter that I barely go near cause I’m scared to be around her my partner irritates me as soon as he opens his mouth.

I fucking hate it, I’m not doing anything fun or productive. I never do any of my hobbies or anything anymore, it’s just pain and distraction of that pain the whole day trough. I used to have a great passion for music, I have barely listened to music, let alone touched an instrument.\n",
      "And I feel so fucking lonely, I stay in my room the whole day with the door locked, it gives me a sense of comfort, as if the outside world doesn’t exist. I see people for like 2 hours a day and that’s probably it. I fucking hate it I fucking hate it. \n",

I’m afraid of showering and shaving, because every time I look down I see a body that doesn’t fit. My face is super masculine and I can’t stand it. I don’t eat except one communal meal with my roommates. I think I’m becoming severely underweight and I don’t give a fuck. I don’t wash my clothes and I don’t clean anything, including myself. My room is a shithole, my desk is full of empty beer cans and bottles. \n",

I don’t want to do things anymore, I don’t want the responsibilities, I just want to die. \n",

      "I've already done really horrible things to other people in the past which I can't stop feeling guilt and regret over. Now I'm also on academic probation in college with no clear major in mind, I lost most my friends at school over the past year thanks to isolating myself and being the idiot I am. I never had anything I cared about and I still don't. Even if my death destroys my family I really don't care because all I want to do is stop feeling like shit and not be around anymore. I've been to two therapists over the past several months and it hasn't helped at all. Now my therapist says I need to take antidepressants but I don't believe getting hooked on drugs(that have dozens of side effects treated with even more drugs with more side effects) for life is a good answer. Death is preferable to that because if anything I don't want to lose my dignity. \n",

I feel so alone. My last almost successful suicide attempt was in2013 and I honestly wished I succeeded. After that I was raped by a guy I dated.. my life has been full of daily nightmares, second guessing myself, and depression where everyone in my life has demanded more of me. My own mother blames me for what happened and when I asked for sympathy I got told I don’t do enough and deserved it. This man has constantly come into my life when I reach my lowest moments and he’s back now.\n",
      "I was dumped by my partner of 5 years and the day after my rapist messages me online then sends me a picture from my own email of us two. The picture I deleted and burned all copies. It broke me, he messaged that it’s my fault for what happened, that I should just let him have his way, that he will be seeing me one way or another, that he’s coming to see me, that he’s outside. My partner was my safety net, I’ve tried reaching out but I feel like I can’t. My friends have been so dismissive and just saying it will get better.. but I’m just so tired of only thinking of how to end it, I’m overwhelmed like I’m drowning.

After being physically attacked by my little sister (who for the record is bigger than I am) for threatening to kill her Naked pallette (stupid attack I know). I have tolerated her self centered egotistical shit for long enough. After being abused and treated like I'm worthless after a night of babysitting I'm now being berated by my own mother for self defense. I have done enough tonight of protecting my dog from her (the dog is terrified of her because she forces the dog into situations which hurt her bad back and hips) and enough of taking her bullshit and now I'm so done. I just want to end myself because maybe then I'll get an escape from this house as the only escape I have as current is school and let's just say that's not a walk in the park either.

      "suicide - I Keep trying, but I always end up stuck againI guess I should preface this with the fact that I am not planning on  committing suicide.  I couldn't, I know that I would pretty much destroy my parents and sister and I cannot be responsible for ruining that many lives.  That being said, I think about it every day, how I just wish I could, allow myself this one bit of selfishness and get away from it all.  I have suffered from chronic depression since I was about 16 or 17. I get over it, I always do.  And when I am feeling better I am so excited, so glad I pushed through and so proud of myself and so grateful to be able to enjoy anything at all.  But I used to get better for months at a time, now if I am lucky its a few weeks. I have permanently screwed up my life.  When I was 18 I went to one of the top universities in the world due to my years of hard work.  I had to drop out because of depression which caused awful grades, just getting out of bed was more than I could handle most days.  Then I tried a local college. I had to drop out because of depression and bad grades.  I then worked at various jobs, finally finding one that made me happy and eventually deciding to go back to school.   I am worse than ever.  If I cant get through school because of this overwhelming attack on myself then I will never get  a good job.  And for someone like me finding a job that interests me (by good I really mean challenges me not pays well) is the only small highlight I can imagine.  I don't want to be like this for the rest of my life, but its the only result I can imagine I would so much rather end this now than be like this for another fifty years.  Yes I am young, 24, but that is what makes it SOO much worse, if I am like this now, what am I going to be like in another ten years?  My mother suffers from depression and is an alcoholic.  She isn't mean or abusive, just withdrawn, usually too drunk to do anything with.  But she has a husband who loves her more than the universe and two daughters who try extremely hard to help her.  From what I can tell her depression didn't really become a problem until her mid to late thirties.  Mine started so much younger and I don't want to end up like her, and of course I won't because I am depressed all of the time and eat all of the time which means that I won't even have  a family of my own one day to help out.  I am just so very tired.  I want nothing to with this life, I wasn't meant for it.  I am so tired of fighting through when there isn't a real point. Why can't it all just stop? I'm done, I wish I wasn't but I am.\n",

I don't know who I can talk to, and I feel like no-one really cares since my problems aren't as big as others. I feel guilty for feeling like this, I have no reason. Sometimes I think that maybe everyone deals with this and it's all in my head. Maybe I'm just overreacting. Maybe it's normal to think about buying a load of over-the-counter medication in case the situation gets worse. Maybe it's normal to not want to leave my room ever and stay there until everything's over. If it is I'm sorry for bothering you. I don't even know if this is the right subreddit to post this in.

Sometimes it flairs up though and I get into major depressive episodes. Im very afraid that I am starting another one of those. I once had an episode last almost a year and all that got me out of it was beginning to take medication. Im so afraid of that happening again. I cant live with that kind of pain. The past few days have been really rough. Ive been depending on weed and still taking my medicine regularly, maybe not as much as I should (supposed to be taking twice a day but only take it religiously in the morning). I didnt wake up crying this morning at least. That’s the worst kind of day. Today im just dull. I cant go anywhere or really do much. Ive wanted to hurt myself again.

I just want to die already, I want to feel the feeling of dark empty nothingness. No matter how hard I try to make life worth living it doesn’t work.

From arguments that he initiate And recently I’ve come to find out that I may be Bipolar and I haven’t told anyone because I’m scared their just gonna think I’m crazy or looking for attention or trying to use it as an excuse for past actions.

Once my depression waned a little, I got my act together, studied, took the SATs, got my GED, and got into a local college on a merit scholarship.

I can't switch to the major I really want (Illustration) because I know I'll end up working minimum wage forever, and my college also requires a portfolio to switch to Illustration, which I don't have because I never took any art courses (thanks to the whole dropping out of school thing). I'm feeling all of my old symptoms coming back. I don't feel hungry, and I've lost interest in eating. I can't fall asleep at night. I keep crying, which I never do.

The fourth one is my cousin, which I now know was a huge mistake to choose to live with. She keeps telling her parents about her personal life, which I play a big part in, and that news gets back to my parents quickly, who then call me to scream at me about an exaggerated or fabricated version of reality. Today my boyfriend was in rage-mode because a professor completely fucked over his GPA, and he came over to my dorm to vent, play some videogames, and calm down. My cousin has an illogical hatred for him, and is constantly talking shit about him to me even though they have literally no interaction with each other, so I thought it probably wouldn't be fun if she came back right then. I texted her \"Hey can you please not come back to the dorm right now, [boyfriend] is over\". She flipped out, started calling me and him names, asking how dare I tell her she can't come back to where she lives, etc. (I should probably add that she was hanging out with a group of people on a separate campus that's a 20 minute bus ride away. She had no plans to come back until I asked her not to, at which point she decided she wanted to come home just to spite me) She then called her parents telling them how I forced her to skip class (???) and that I kicked her out of our room. They called my parents, and I received a screaming phone call about being a shitty person and trying to destroy my cousin's college career. Now her parents want her to change dorms. She came back a few hours later and has given me the silent treatment despite my repeated explanation of how it was a misunderstanding and I didn't mean to offend her or make her feel unwelcome.\n",

I don't belong here, I'm not an intellectual, I'm not studious, I don't even think I want to learn anymore. I don't want to be in college anymore, but I can't drop out. It would be incredibly ungrateful to throw away a scholarship like that, and then what would I do? I can't move back home - that's where all of my problems come from. I have literally no money to my name, and there's no chance of my parents helping me if I drop out. I would go get any job I could and save every penny to try to find somewhere else to live, but I don't have a car. I feel trapped, and while I wouldn't say this is the most depressed I've ever felt, this is the sharpest turn downwards my depression has ever taken. I don't want to wake up tomorrow.

They were so beautiful I fell in love instantly. She was actually dating an extremely toxic person who at the time sold drugs and was in jail for doing so. When I stepped in she was head over heels for me. She recognized my clean cut life style and would say things like, \"I feel so safe with you.

Drug addicted parents who would beat on eachother and were always in and out of jail were the biggest of her issues. We have butted heads and had our ups and downs, but through it all i have stayed consistent in my love for her and my daughters. Things eventually came back around and were close to perfect again. So we decided to set our wedding date. October 8th 2020. We have been planning this wedding all year. Spending a shit ton of money and sending out invites. All of this planning has put a lot of stress on me. I've been having some crazy dreams. Dreams of her being involved with other people. Men, women, and even some of my exes. These dreams are a nightly thing now and I can't get them to stop. I have reached out to her for reassurance a few times, but I can only do that so many times before she becomes annoyed. Through all of this anxiety and fear for my wedding, I think she's starting to view me as weak or needy. I've never been either of those before now. She's becoming distant. Acts of love feel obligated coming from her, as if she's just going through the motions. These half hearted forced emotions im receiving are only making things worse for my anxiety. \n",

      "suicide - All my problems are invalidI just came to this realization on reddit. I realized that not only am I not actually as smart as I have been told I was all my life, but all those years spent suffering and being a general wreck were all just invalid. The stalking issues? Typical for an average male. The depression? I might as well be faking it. Social anxiety? Just mild autism. The only valid problems I have are OCD and Autism. I don’t have PTSD or ADHD, just a social death sentence. All my problems that are a little valid were self-inflicted. I love being broken and damaged. My parents have wasted probably millions of dollars to find out what was wrong with me and to treat me. I’m so paranoid and my victim complex is so big, that I think i’m oppressed or going to be oppressed as a white male. My life has been turned upside down, and i’m not exactly sure how I can go on. The guilt and shame I feel after doxxing, stalking, wasting millions, and generally being an asshole are so immense. I feel like I might kill myself tonight. \n",

      "suicide - Can't stop loathing myself, need someone to listen.Last summer, I cheated on my girlfriend of 6 months.  It lasted about two weeks, and I honestly have nothing to say for myself.  I was abroad and I lost my mind.  She made the first approach but I didn't fight it as much as I should have.  I confessed everything when I came back, and she was furious with me but stayed with me.  It was a rocky 8 months where she didn't trust me, and we were always scared of running into the 3rd person on campus (she goes to our college) and igniting all that anger and hate all over again.  Eventually she couldn't handle it and left me.  We stayed good friends, still talking, and still almost being in a relationship, but that has since stopped, her putting her distance from me.  Throughout this entire time, I've always hated myself.  I think about it everyday.  How I destroyed one of the best relationships I've ever had, and ruined someone who cared so much for me and gave me so much.  I don't know how to stop hating myself and loathing myself.  I know that I have to forgive myself but I'm not sure how.  I have no one to talk to that's been in the same position.  I'm ashamed to tell other people, and the people I've told don't know how to help me.  I'm a good person that made a really terrible mistake and I feel like it's pushing my life off it's rails.  I can imagine what my life had been like if I just pushed back that one moment, and it drives me crazy and I feel like I can't control myself when that happens.  I feel like I'm living in the wrong parallel universe and I want to get out.  What can I do?  \n",

The number one thing I want every one to know is that not a single human cuased this, there is nothing any one couldve done differently or at all, except of course myself. The why is more than a simplistic reason, it is not cut and dry or black and white. I have thought about suicide daily since I was fifteen years old. I have seldom had days in which my mind was not my worst enemie. \n",
      "\tI see the world in a different way from most. Everything is constantly and consistantly jumbled. Numbers, faces, letters, words, thoughts. I see things backwards, sideways, upside down, and sometimes even blurred. I hide this and I hide well. I have told people that I am dyslexic, off hand, but what I really mean is  I am in a perpetual state of confusion. I try so hard, to learn all that I can, or at least take a jab at it. I do this becuase I am afriad of being seen as stupid, and having that voice in my head be at all justified in its mocking of how unintelligent I really am. So one reason why is that I am tired of being in a perpetual state of confusion. \n",
      "\tI am not sure when it started, I'm actually not really sure when anything started, my memory is fleeting at best. Some where along the line my mind began to tell me that I am worthless. I don't mean on a bad day I had a passing thought. I mean every single day, be it a bad day, a normal day, or even an amazing day. At some point when I start to think about anything that little voice seeps in and starts to go blow by blow. It is always there to reassure me that I am worthless, stupid, a failure. I can not eat without it telling me I will only get fat, and more worthless, I cant not read without it laughing and calling me stupid when I jumble something up, I can not work without it telling me that I am a failure and its only a matter of time before I am fired or give up. It is always there to promise me that I am infact worthless. So why number two, I am so so so tired of trying to live while my mind is consistently telling me I am failing at that to. \t\n",
      "\tI am fucking crazy, not because of the aforementioned voice, not because of my stomach turning anxiety, or my mood swings, or depression. I am literally fucking insane. I have five, yes five, voices in my head, that is excluding the aforementioned. These voices are constantly fighting, with me and with eachother. So an example would be that I want to go bowling with my friends, so like any normal person I begin to think how to bring it up to them, this is where the voices the come in. Voice 1 will tell me to just ask, be blunt. Voice 2 will tell me to ease it into the conversation. Voice 3 will tell me I am stupid and to just shut up and sit down and pretend to be content. Voice 4 will tell me bowling is lame, and I will look stupid for asking. Voice 5 will tell me to ignore voice 4. Then the fighting begins, and I am stuck helpless with this look of fake content on my face, pretending thier arent five voices in my head argueing about fucking bowling. So maybe you have noticed I am not all there all of the time, some even call me a space cadet, this is why. So yes another why, I am tired of not being in control of my own brain. \n",
      "\tAnxiety, oh anxiety my sweet toxic lover. Im not really sure when it got so bad, I am afraid all of the time. The only moments when I feel a sliver of safety, is when I am in my room with my dog, and on occasion my boyfriend. Otherwise I am irrationally fearing things. What am I fearing you ask, it can be as simple as my jeans ripped, that person thinks I am ugly, or I am going to spill this drink and everyone will laugh. It can also be as crazy as everyone in this resteruant thinks I am crazy, that random man on the bus can read my mind, maybe that lady is a witch. It can also be as extreme as, what if my dog is dead, what if someone in my family is dead or dieing and not telling me, what if today I get arrested, or mugged, what if today I get fired, or in an accident and die or become a vegetable. So you combine this anxiety with my five voices inflating the thoughts, my voice that is always there to reassure me of my worth(well lack there of), and my own rationale, what you have is enough for anyone to never want to leave thier room.I am tired of being afraid So there a fourth reason why. \n",
      "\tI could on, and on, about the inner workings of my mind, but upon writing this I have come to realize that the answer is in fact simple, it is cut and dry and black and white. The why, is so simple, I am so fucking tired. I am not the kind of tired a nap can fix, or an energy drink, or a good nights rest. I am the kind of tired, where I can not will myself awake, it is a forceful battle to climb out of my bed, it is a struggle and I am loosing everyday. I am the kind of tired where the only solution is to sleep and never wake up. \n",

      "suicide - i need help but am afraid to check in to an ERMy woman left me on our anniversary tonight. I dont know why. She couldn't explain. She said she had things to figure out. Everything weve built together is gone and i have no idea why. She won't speak to me or return calls or texts. I dont know what happened. Everything has been good. We have had fights just like any couple does and this is so out of the blue. Ive been staring at a wall and for the last six hours my thoughts have become progressively darker. Ive thought of methods and that doesn't frighten me anymore. The pain and confusion and lack of context is overwhelming. Ive had depression most of my life beginning as a teenager. Ive been prone to drug/alcohol abuse in the past. I dont own a gun because i know i have these tendencies. The woman i was with knows i had some trouble with these kind of thoughts. She had too in the past. I cant bear the thought of life without her. I can't bear the idea of seeing her smiling with someone else. We have always been open and faithful to each other and this comes as such an unexpected and inexplicable shock i can't begin to rationalize it. In my mind the question why is dominating my thoughts. I dont know why she left. I dont have a clue. The life weve built has disappeared without a reason or warning. I want to tell her i feel this way but i feel guilty if i did. I feel like shed think i was trying to manipulate her or get her attention and thats the last thing i want to do. She was my best friend and this is insane. If i just knew why then i would know how to feel. If she was seeing someone else then at least i could be angry. If she wasnt happy at least id know id failed her. But i dont know a thing. She wouldn't tell me. Just that she didn't want me anymore and that she was leaving. I feel used. I feel an incredible disillusionment knowing she doesn't want me anymore. Everyday we gave each other love and dedication and i dont know why she wanted to leave. Thinking about it knowing shes so close but so far away makes me feel incredibly powerless. I was going to marry this woman. I stopped drinking for this woman. It feels like ive been shattered. I never sinned against her. She always told me i was perfect to her.

Earth is a depressing place as it is. I met someone who changed my view on life and made me want to be more than i am. I met someone i could dedicate my being to and then found out i wasnt wanted anymore. Its breaking me. I know i wont be able to cope with out emily in my life. I know ill relapse back into alcoholism and depression and drugs again. I know i won't be able to focus at work and i know going back to drugs will prevent me from finding work i can invest myself in. I feel like the best option is to die on my own terms. I hate knowing the wake such an act leaves on people close to me but i also understand death is there at all times waiting to pull us from this world. I dont understand why people cope with death differently if its intentional instead of an accident. I think itd be best to make it look accidental that way my family can cope with it as a tragedy instead of something they would feel guilty about. I want to go to the hospital but i think i would panic and end up restrained against my will. I dont want to be medicated or restrained. I dont want to be told life is worth living. I didnt ask to come into this world. Why is it unreasonable that i should want to leave it? Why does this hurt so badly that i would rather lose my sensory ability to even conceive of what pain is? Ive done so many hallucinogens, LSD, DMT, that i have deep seeded disillusions about what life or afterlife or spirit even mean. I made my peace with my mortality a long time ago. I know my consciousness will cease when my body can no longer support the physiological processes and systems occuring within this vessel we call a body. I dont know how to articulate this well. I feel i am just random matter and awareness and that my sense of self and identity are simply a construct of relativity. I feel like i have suffered an irreparable wound. I dont think she and i will reconcile whatever this is that has caused her to want to leave. I dont think ill ever get to know why and i the thought of spending everyday of the rest of my life not knowing why. Thinking about what could have been. Thinking about why she gave up on what we had together is more than i can bear. I dont know how to face the world without her. Everything i have been doing in my life, has been to build a better life for us and now its gone without explanation. \n",

      "I feel if i go to an ER im going to be given medication. Im going to talk to some stranger who has shallow life view about how life is precious and going to tell me to think of my loved ones. I have thought about that though. I know life is precious but id rather not feel than go through this uncertainty and confusion. I feel if i went to the er and got help i might end up not being allowed to leave. I might not be allowed to go to work and end up losing my job which in turn would prevent me from paying my rent, car note, etc... It seems like it would make life even more complicated and uncertain. It doesnt seem worth it. The only reason im holding on is in the hope i can talk to emily again. Just to see her face one more time. To see her smile. But in the back of my mind i know thats gone already. Like dropping a ring in the sea. Its gone the second it slides beneath the waves and right now i feel all the justifications to stay alive are leaving me just like she did. Im hesitant to even make this post. I found this thread googling what to do if you're suicidal. I can't articulate my thoughts well verbally so i didnt want to call a hotline. Ive lurked on reddit for a long time and i feel ridiculous making an account for the first time just because the faint possibilty she wants to see me again might exist and it wouldn't be fair to her for me to do something until i knew with absolute certainty there's no coming back. I really dont know what else to type. anyone please talk to me.\n",

      "suicide - I don't care to live.I was raised by a monster. He killed himself and I never expected to live that long. I expected him to finally lose his sense of reality entirely and just kill us. Telling someone never occurred to me. I grew up being raised into some form of stockholm syndrome. Him threatening to kill us all (me, my mother, my sister, anyone blood related basically.) I don't know what comfortable is. I grew up in fear. I went to sleep every night with a knife in my hands. Expecting him to kick in the door and start screaming and beating on me. I should of called the cops. But fear left me paralyzed most of the time. After I graduated he shot himself. I felt nothing when I found the body. That was a year ago. Nothing's changed really. I'm still afraid all the time. I've spent my entire life being terrified. It's stuck on me. I grew up in what most people describe as a war zone. My kind mother fighting my father, a sick twisted psychopath who enjoyed making others feel less than human, and watching them suffer and humiliating them, screaming horrible things that never made sense. It was terrifying. He reduced us to less than human. The worst stories you've read about how cruel one person can be to another was everyday of my life. Like we we're his personal slaves. I don't recall much of what was said. It's just him screaming at the top of his lungs whatever sick thing he could think of. Incest. Rape. Racism. Murder. Screaming at my 4 yr old sister that she's a dirty fucking whore nigger. Whatever he could say to make you wish you were dead. There was no reason, if he got angry about anything suddenly we were his metaphorical punching bags. My mother doesn't understand how dead inside I am. For her that was a bad chapter in her life. Me? That's how I was raised. To feel nothing. To be empty. But fear or hate. I don't want to go on anymore. Even getting stoned doesn't help. I don't know what it is to feel anything else. I just want to stop. I've already lived through hell. I don't want to go on anymore. I don't want to make friends, get in shape and get a gf, give my life meaning or any of that crap. I just want to die. \n",

      "A little background: I met the love of my life when I was a teenager.  That was about 16 years ago.  We had an off-again, on-again relationship, she ended up moving away, I thought I’d never find another quite like her.  It was more than just infatuation, I would always compare every woman I’d date to her and they’d come up short.  I never broke contact with her and we’d have a fling now and then when she’d come to town, and the feelings never really went away completely. I just couldn’t settle... and I couldn’t be happy.  My mind was always in a fucked up place.  Until about 8 years ago when decided to make it official and I moved across a few states and we got married, moved in together, etc.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Everything seemed perfect, and things were great.  We have a decent retirement account accumulating.  We fantasize about going on trips and maybe just picking everything up and moving somewhere else for the fun of it.  Just months ago we would hold hands while walking down the street.  We’ve always taken the long view of things.  We refinanced our house this fall.  I thought my life was pretty much set on “cruise” and that I knew how things would turn out.  \n",
      "\n",
      "And then recently she was diagnosed with a degenerative disease/disorder (I don’t want to divulge too much).  As she puts it, it “flipped a switch”, mentally, and now she feels like she has limited time, and is very pessimistic about how her health will be in the future.  She’s convinced she’ll be in a wheelchair in 10-15 years.  Almost overnight, she has become very depressed and has started to loathe the idea of coming home to me, to our house, etc. She feels like she needs to go out and “have fun” as she puts it.  It started with hints of an open marriage.  I was resistant to the idea but I said I’d give it some thought.  Then I found out she’d been flirting with a guy at work, and so I read her email and saw they’d been emailing back and forth for a few weeks and I could see where it was going.  I took that like a shovel to the head.\n",
      "\n",
      "She said she thought I had lost interest in her because of the medical thing, and that she was confused about everything.  I told her that this wasn’t the case and I said we could explore doing things that would cheer her up but she had to do two things:  Determine if she loves me and wants to make it work, and be honest with me.  She agreed.  Well a few weeks later I find that she had made a secret email account and they’d still been carrying on, and after grilling her when she came home she admits that she kissed him.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I felt like everything was crumbling around me.  For the past few weeks I’ve had trouble even getting out of bed and I’ve started drinking hard liquor.  That discussion almost had her leaving the house but I convinced her to stay (the hotel would have cost us money - we have joint finances and money is tight).  We talked some more and now I’ve reached a point where I basically gave her my blessing to have her fun with this guy, as long as it’s just fun and she loves me.  She said she won’t know until she does it but that she basically has to.  I feel like if I try to fight it it’s going to happen anyway.  I’ve basically resigned myself to accepting that I have to just suck it up if I want to get through this and return to the happy times I remember.  I think she’s going to get this out of her system and then settle back down.  But I feel almost like I’m being raped; allowing this to happen and just holding my feelings in so I don’t alienate her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here’s why this is posted here.  The thought of losing her makes me want to crawl under a bridge with a bottle of whiskey on a 0 degree night and just freeze to death.  Literally.  Or maybe suck-start a pistol.  I don’t know.  I did the math and if I have to pay this mortgage myself I’m fucked.  I’ll be living off pocket change for the next 20 years.  It also means I won’t be able to leave the job I hate, there’s simply no way I’ll make the money I’m making now.  I would have been able to start over career-wise by leaning on her (as she did a few years ago) but on my own with these bills, it’s impossible.  I also will never have a connection with another person like I have with her.  \n",
      "\n",
      "In short, I don’t want to live if this happens.  Which is why I’m putting myself through this, trying to accommodate her.  I view her situation like a drug addict or alcoholic.  I’m hoping that she’ll get better and we can go back to how things were.  \n",
      "\n",
      "But for now I feel like I’m being violated.  Not so much by the potential (or actual) affair, but because she lied to me about it.  And now, I have trouble with the fact that I’m letting her do this.  It just feels like I’m violating myself, and the thought that this experiment might fail; that she’ll carry it on and realize that she feels nothing for me, that hurts like hell.  I can’t tell if she actually wants me to work with her on this or if she just feels guilty about how she’s making me feel and is trying to make me feel better by sticking around as long as she can stand to.  I just don’t know.  I just know that I don’t feel right at all and I don’t know how to handle this.  I don’t have anyone else to talk to.  She has always been that person.  For some messed up reason I don't want her to feel guilty about all of this.  I just want her to be happy.\n",

      "-I think about food constantly. I love food. Especially that unhealthy, greasy, salty nastiness that everyone says you should cut out of your life forever. Being a typical female, I am horrified of becoming fat, which I'm probably well on my way to being. I'm not even chubby yet, but I'm definitely not bikini material- Just average. However, this absolutely plagues me. The more I think about food, and how I should diet [or make a 'lifestyle choice'], the more I want to eat. However, I'm afraid to eat, because I'm already big enough. Which leads to me doing the worst possible thing- binging. I don't throw up after or take laxatives, although I admit both of those things I have given substantial thought to. I even frequently google pro-ana websites for tips on how not to be such a fatty. I have little to no self control over what I eat. I've kept food journals, tried to get others to help me make better eating decisions, tried to get my parents not to buy nasty crap for me to eat. None of it works. And what's worse is I can cook really well- fuck no I don't want broccoli, I want cheesy hashbrowns! Load up the fat please, *I apparently don't have enough of it around my waist*. \n",

My fear of him led me to not take the SAT/ACT because he was at the same testing site as I was- I was signed up and ready to go until I saw him there. I fled to the bathroom to call my parents to pick me up. They yelled at me, and did eventually come get me.

We also have the 'arbitrary bullshit' arguments that everyone has with their parents. However, mine get blown out of proportion. They will not listen to my side, they call names, criticize me, and lie to get their way and win the argument. They placed me in therapy after I blew up at them and told them to stop doing such things because it was not respectful. I understand the concept of **my house my rules**, but it gets ridiculous. My dad is also a self-proclaimed sexist.

Her sister is famous, and her parents basically own the town I live in.

      "-I worked at a Walgreen's for a while last year. I was a pretty excellent employee. Ended up getting canned when someone told the boss they saw me 'out and about' on a day I called in sick. I had food poisoning that day. Never got the chance to explain myself. The next job I got was at a law office. I got laid off after two weeks, 'we never should have hired you. we just don't have enough business.' A week later, they call me back. 'We have business now, come work for us again.' Two weeks later, I get laid off again. 'You aren't a good worker, your work ethic sucks, you never do what you're told, you make too many mistakes, also we don't have enough business.' I was an excellent worker. I know for a fact I didn't make mistakes, and my work ethic ruled- I was always busy, and when I had a lull in my work, I helped other people. But it doesn't matter, because if I apply for a new job, they aren't going to believe me. They're going to believe my former employer. So, can't use that on my resume either. That's two out of three black marks on my record at only 20 years of age. The other job is fine, I have excellent references from them. But two out of three is not promising. The second time I got laid off has also instilled even more self-doubt in me; did I really make that many mistakes? Am I still making mistakes? No other job would want me if I can't even do the basic crap from that law office. Also, my aunt just applied for my old job. Not a terrible thing to do, but I almost feel as if I should be more offended... it seems rude, in a way.\n",

      "suicide - Ex-boyfriend killed his mumI dated this man for 5 years. I met him when I was 18 and he was 6 years older. I didn't know my self worth back then and was not good at spotting narcissistic traits in people. 3 months ago, during psychosis which came upon him after using ayhausca, he stabbed his mum 77 times in a row, I've heard from police that he stabbed her and walked away and then repeatedly came back to hurt her more. Apparently he kept doing so infront of the pandemics. I really miss his mum, she did everything to help support his life, too much. She was like a second mother to me and I loved her dearly. On the day in which he killed her, my dad had a strange foreboding feeling, and asked if we could hang out, he picked me up at 4pm. If I had slept at the house that night, I would have been directly in front of my ex's line of path before his mum. Many of my friends have told me that they think it would have definitely had been me if my dad did not pick me up. On top of all this trauma, someone I do not know messaged my mum, with screenshots of things my ex wrote to her 2.5 years ago. The messages were like that from a psychological horror, my ex had explicitly described every way he had been trying to control and manipulate me. I found out that when I was suicidally depressed, he had been whispering in my ears that I should kill myself every night, to my unawares. I was not aware that he had been researching how to abuse me and get away with it, often in covert ways. I am really freaked out that he said he would conduct satanic rituals and curse me at night time. I do not believe there are demonic forces who have power over me, yet now, I keep getting nightmares about things related to the thought that he did this. And I keep imagining the things he may have told me when we were sleeping. Now I am battling to survive each day, my head tells me to kill myself on a consistent basis, at least every 10 minutes a day. But today it has been even more incessant. I know that I have quite a few good friends and they and my family deeply care for me and love me. I feel guilty that I think my pain is worse than what theirs would be if they lost me. But I don't think they understand that I feel like I am walking through fire. I can't remember the last time I was happy. Psychological and professional assistance and appointments, and a range of medications I have tried don't seem to be working. I am desperate to find some sort of reason that my life is worth continuing. I am concerned that my impulse levels are high. On the way home today I was at the train station and had the urge to jump, and I was fighting these urges with all my love for the close people in my life. I saw two transit guards walk near me as I was going to jump, and felt guilt consume me. I couldn't let them witness my suicide which could potentially trigger them to have PTSD or depression. I think I have got to fight this, for my loved ones, even if it may always be painful to live with my trauma. I have nearly finished a bachelors degree and I have volunteered a lot this year at a horse riding association for bettering the lives of children with disabilities. I would never want those lovely and innocent kids to be questioning why I wasn't there anymore. I was prepared to hang myself earlier this year, but before I was going to finally put the noose around my neck, I had a vision of hundreds of people crying. Maybe it would be expected to say have only close friends and family to be severely impacted by that, but my vision showed to me all the lives of people i have touched with kindness and generosity, and they were all crying and looking towards my eyes with utter despair. That was when I realised I couldn't go ahead. And it helps that I write that to remember my vision. I do not feel like I can go to hospital because when I last was admitted, I was released from the hospital quite soon as the mental health professionals could not see any risk for me, or maybe are desensitied to people that are suicidal. Or maybe thought people with meth psychosis needed more desperate admission. They probably were more at risk to other people. Anyway... that is a lot of rambling. From this I can gather that I cannot die but must live on, I do think that my friends and family care far too much about me for me to leave some of the most close ones with life long depression. I also realised this when I opened my Facebook timeline to first seeing a post of an aquaintance of mine, who shared a photo of a smiling man, her uncle who she had lost 14 years ago, and who she sheds tears for every night. The love from my loved ones is too strong a force.\n",

Yes, I graduated hs and got into college but the stress and anxiety are killing me, I don't even know if it's all worth it. The only thing that I'm good at is probably quitting. I quit piano as a kid bc it was too difficult and my parents spent my entire childhood reminding me that I'm a quitter. Turns out they're right. In college I quit a research program bc i was burnt out from schoolwork and didn't have time for that; quit a job at a school publication for the same reason. Now I have another job at a small local newspaper writing stuff that nobody will ever read or gaf about. And I'm thinking about quitting that as well, since it's totally meaningless and is draining my energy and will to live. I recently relocated back to the country where my family immigrated from b/c of how badly the US is handling the virus, but i still attend college in the US remotely. Let's just say the time difference is not serving me well. My sleep pattern is non-existent, and I had to find a new therapist since now I'm out of state. Geez, if I were to just die from overwork tonight i wouldn't object to it. anything that ends this suffering.

It extends to yet another thing that I have hidden about myself, and what the main point of my post is. I only know of one person who is aware of it, and that is my mother. One day, at the age of nine years old, I came to the realization that I would not always be a kid. That I was one day going to turn eighteen, and I was currently halfway to that mark. I began to hyperventilate, and I started screaming in a panic attack. It was one of my largest fears. My mother ran into my room, and began to hold me as I was almost flailing in a state of pure confusion and fear. I have always been one to hide what is wrong with me, but in that moment, I simply told her. I told her how I was so incredibly fearful of growing up. How I detested the very idea. She told me, and I quote, \"you don't ever have to, baby. you can stay as my world forever.\" I felt slight relief in that moment. However, I knew that regardless of her words, I would still eventually technically grow up.\n",

I didn't just have to go through a male puberty, no, I had to also go through the stages of growing up. That is to say, what was expected of me. But in the end, I would always secretly resist. I could tell that my mother had forgotten all about that night where I told her about my fear and dread of growing up. It was more than apparent that she only said those things because she knew I eventually would stop caring and fearing to grow up, not because she actually felt that she was okay with me staying as a child. I eventually promised myself that if I ever reached my eighteenth birthday, then I would... ): Well, the day surely arrived, and while I tried, it was futile against my other fear of death. Apparently, there are so many people who believe that all suicidal people do not fear death. Well, I can assure all of them that they are sorrily mistaken. Just because I want to die, is no indication that I do not fear the death itself. Regardless, the day did arrive, and while I smiled through the day, there was no present or celebration that could make my heart smile. It was my fear of growing up that had made me loath each and every one of my birthdays. Needless to say, this one was the worst of all. I was practically dead the second the clock struck midnight on the date of February 7th, 2017. No more childhood to spend as a girl or have others accept me as a girl. No more childhood period.

People were accusing me of being a predator because I wanted to remain my mental age. Just because I want to be my mental age, doesn't mean I'm willing to date somebody my mental age.

I waited my entire life to come out about wanting to remain a kid, and this was my response... This was how I was being treated. I can't say that I expected differently, but it can not change the heartbreak. A week or so later, I had a therapy call. She told me that I had to find a new psychologist because they only saw kids or people in school. For the very first time in the four years I have seen her, she heard me wail in sadness. For the first time, I didn't care about holding back my tears. She was the only therapist I ever loved. The only therapist that ever understood me. And she was telling me that I had to go. I apparently have another call with her today. But it feels so pointless. If I can't have her, then I will see nobody else. I am in so much pain right now. I am being treated differently by everybody around me because I am an \"adult.\" I am sorry, but no, I am not. If I can not remain young, then go ahead and end me. I have no other reason to live. I can't even be a girl. The only thing I see happening as a result of making this post, is all of you giving me the same treatment that I just received on Twitter, but hey, I might as well try to gain approval... I have left so much information out, and that is probably for the better. I am tired of the nightmares of growing up and losing my hair. I am tired of all of this pain. I am tired... of being treated as a male, an adult, and a pervert as an extension. I have the same mind that I did at the physical age of 12-15. The only difference, is the amount of depression, self hatred and fear that has accumulated within my soul as a result of being seen as older, and as a male.

People saying that its a sad thing for me to leave highschool because university is going to be worse. My dad saying that my future boss will yell at me daily even worse then what he does to me. Multiple people saying that having a job sucks. I'm just having so much doubt that things are gonna change for the better. University is pretty much the same as high school.

      "suicide - I overdosed on Wellbutrin as a way to escape, now my mom is punishing me.. (kind of a vent)So this happened about 2 days after school started on August 10th, and I have been having issues. The teachers and students in the school are very nice, but what they teach is kind of patronizing me. It is a religious school, and to me what they are saying is that girls do nothing but seduce men, and so you can't wear certain clothes like tights, skirts/shorts above knee, etc.. and if you do you are basically wanting attention. We aren't even allowed to wear jean pants on Friday's, only jean skirts. And if the skirt is long enough but the slit goes above your knee, you get dress coded and fined $10. There are also other ridiculous rules like if you don't go to church weekly you get kicked out... there are so many I won't type it here because I want to keep things short. Anyway,  I might sound like I am complaining, but I have been to religious schools my entire life, and none of those have been this patronizing. I even told my mom and other family members how crazy these rules are, and they aren't on my side.. If this school didn't cost 6K I would leave, but I can't since I have a scholarship and my mom would have to pay 6K if I get kicked out. Plus, the only other school near my house is a big school in a not so good area, and I don't do well in large crowds b/c of social anxiety and something else. So I have no choice but to stay... All the religious pressure and ridiculous rules caused me to break.. so I decided I wouldn't go to school the next day. I didn't want to tell my mom because she would say no since it is the first week of school. So I took matters into my own hands. I didn't want to go back, I was done. I was so depressed for years, I attempted suicide in the past but i didnt have the guts to do it. I took my prescription bottle of wellbutrin and i took a handful of pills, I went to the bathroom and started taking them. I stopped at about halfway through because I scared to die, so I hid the rest under my pillow. Then I decided to go to bed, but I changed my mind and went to my moms room. When i was at the door of her room I started to hallucinate and see black blobs moving around, and i started hyperventilating and my mom was worried. She saw that my pupils were dialated so i just told her i was tired. She walks me to my room, and right when Im near my bed, I fall and have my first seizure. All i remember is waking up on the ground and paramedics were over me, and then a few moments later i have another seizure in the ambulance. I was in the hospital from Wednesday night to Saturday Morning, and I had to go to a mental hospital for around the next 3 days. I wanted to die every day. But i felt even worse seeing my mom upset. I was only allowed to call her in the mental hospital, so I couldn't see her and I just felt sad. We also had a family session, where a therapist and I were be in the same room, and my mom was on the phone. She said she cleaned out my room, went through EVERYTHING, and I became mortified. I had a box that said please do not open, which she opened, and saw all my medications i didnt take. I also had a folder where i wrote letters about what was going on, stuff i didnt want her to see. She found and read all of those, and also revealed the secrets to the therapist in the room, which made me really embarrassed and quite mad. Then, out of nowhere, she decides to ground me, by taking all of my electronics. I became upset because to me she really had no reason to do that. She never once mentioned that until after she saw my secrets. I am a technology person, so i usually like to do coding, and i had gotten a laptop for school, and bought other electronics for school as well. She took all of those, even my old DSI. She also said she would go through them. I wasnt really upset about that because I had recently reset those devices. I cant even at least text my friends, who are worried about me. Yes, I still havent gotten my electronics back to this day, so i am typing this on my moms computer.  She wont tell me why she took them away.. and she seems not nice like she normally is. I get that what happened has scared her, and it is my fault, but do i really deserve to get grounded after i come out the hospital? i would try to ask her why she is grounding me, but she just doesn't answer. I really want to know. I wont ask anymore because she still seems upset. I have to end this here, and if there are any questions i will reply as quickly as i can. I may have left stuff out.\n",

      "So now, about my life: I'am currently an 18 year old male attending university in the United States. Throughout high school I encountered many people, some of which manifested into my very best friends up until my junior year. This would mark an extremely negative year and turning point in my life as it was the first time I consumed LSD with my friend who I will call Chris. He was my role model throughout my adolescent years and more than I had hoped any friend could be. I loved him like a brother. Our acid trip was as normal as can be expected of two people trying psychedelics for the first time. That was until we got back to his place. Upon arriving Chris entered the shower with his girlfriend at the time for what seemed like an eternity. Then after that moment passed he suddenly appeared between myself and the television I happened to be watching at the time, restrained me to the chair, and repeated over and over again, \"life is a simulation\", \"life is a simulation\", \"life is a simulation.\" Perhaps this may seem innocent enough to the average reader but any person who's done any kind've mind altering drugs knows just how despicable this truly was. Shortly there after I experience what can only be described as a psychotic episode. I faded in and out of conciousness for the rest of the night. All that I really recal is that I ended up back at my house with Chris and the rest of my so called friends hating me. Everyone that is except for a girl that I will Charlotte. She had been my friend for even longer than Chris and now that he was no longer in my life I naturally gravitated towards her to make sense of it all. At first for purely plutonic objectives which later blossomed into a romance. We dated for 3 months, she took my virginity, and broke up with me after I confessed that I had always secretly loved her throughout out long friendship. I now have no real friends. They invite me to party's but are always walking on eggshells hoping not to ignite the ever impending bad trip that they believe resides In my head, all except charlotte of course who knows what really took place that night but refuses to clarify on my behalf for fear of being ostrichized herself. Instead she distracts herself with the various \"shitty guys\" (her words not mine) that she frequently sleeps with then proceeds to complain to me about. I see her frequently at these gatherings on the weekends between all of my old friends, only to return to university alone. At these party's I frequently feign inhebriation only to pretend to fall asleep. Then I subsequently spend the night either sneaking out the back to smoke or crying into my air up mattress, envious of her new dipshit confidant. Long story short chris' brain is baked from acid and is no longer capable of fending for himself I am desperately still in love with charlotte even though she betrayed me almost two years ago and I'am incapable of showing myself to the outside world who hates me. Death is imminent all because I can't stop thinking of how much I loveChris and Charlotte, my two best friends who I ruined.\n",

Is there anything that can be done to get him help as well as relieve the pressure on her, beyond what's already been done?  She feels that this weekend will be the worst yet for him (not sure why), and if anything can be done I'd appreciate advice.\n",

      "I just turned 16 last October 30. Being raised by a single mother (teacher and soon-to-be principal), living in a house with a really loving and caring family (grandma, grandpa, uncle). Now that we've got formalities out of the way, let's get into the shit.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was a token student. A kid everyone knew as \"that one smart kid\" or someone with unlimited career opportunities. My depression actually started 6th grade, which sounds weird but hear me out. After the shit I witnessed with my mom and dad arguing all the time when I was still a kid, I turned my attention to reading magazines and huge books on planes, trains, cars and more to get my mind off of the arguments that made me worry. I figure that's how I became so mature at that young age, and also how I became so smart. However, I was and still am an introvert, I suck at talking to people and I always make things so awkward during conversations. For reasons unknown, I was bullied throughout 6th grade... And it continued until the end of middle school (which was actually my best time in school).\n",

      "Come freshman year of high school, I continue to do well, which is fine, and my depression is still there but I wasn't suicidal. Sophomore year is when everything went to shit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now sophomore year I overwhelmed myself with all these honors and AP classes - I was up past midnight doing homework almost daily, which I could manage. What was really shitty though was not the AP classes, but it was in fact Chemistry and Algebra 2. My algebra 2 teacher didn't know how to teach and really shouldn't be a teacher; she did not help me understand anything at all, even in tutoring. My chemistry teacher was a total douchebag and I was too afraid to ask him anything, even in tutoring for the fear of being wrong and the fact that he practically called me stupid in front of the class 3rd quarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each progress report I got that year was pretty bad. I got yelled at by my mom and I cried and I cried, and prayed to God that things would get better. Things didn't get better at all, and I ditched praying. I felt my family getting farther away from me, like I was a disappointment, something really bad in an Asian family like mine. Because of this, I punched myself in the nose every day to bleed without cutting myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "My final grades were really bad. The only classes I failed were Algebra 2 and Chemistry, both with D+'s. To top it off, my chemistry teacher put in a comment on my grade saying \"Great student/credit to class.\" I was brutally devastated and I cried hysterically every night. I don't even know if I can go to a university or join the USAF anymore, and if so, might as well end it now.\n",
      "\n",
      "Come junior year (now!) and things are a bit better grade wise (even though I get yelled at for having a B+) but there's this thought at the back of my head that nothing matters anymore. Even if I get a good grade now, my future is still dull due to my performance from sophomore year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then I have some other problems. I feel like a fucking loser. My friends don't feel like friends anymore, I was backstabbed by two girls I was friends with (not girlfriend), which just happened recently so I am still pretty fucking down. I feel like a lot of people distance themselves away from me because of how negative and gloomy I am, and I'm just an all around awkward person to be around and to talk to. I guess people look at me as \"that weirdo\".\n",

      "Speaking of couples, one of the girls that backstabbed me went behind my back saying that she wasn't interested in having a boyfriend when she told me she liked me (pretty contradictory, I know) and went to homecoming with one of my friends. I'm no longer friends with her, even though she thinks we still are friends.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now I have standards for girls, and I have my eyes set on this really nice Asian girl who sits by me in two classes. Token student, professional, knows what she's doing, fun to talk to despite my awkwardice and nervousness. Knowing my luck, I'll never have her though, and besides, I've never had a girlfriend before.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, I guess this was sort of a rant about my life. I don't even think I made any points clear. All I can say is that all of the problems I stated above are really hitting me now, and I think it's time to end things. I really have no purpose of being here, nor do I think I'll become anything I want to be in the future.\n",

It just feels so amazing to be treated like a human being instead of a walking pocket pussy. Reason why I say this is because last time him and I hung out, things started to getting pretty wacky. But before we started doing anything ~ u n h o l y ~, I asked him if we could just stop where we were at. Here's the kicker: he respected that. He didn't beg me, make me feel guilty, or gaslight me. He simply looked at me and asked if he could at could at least just hug and kiss me.

I have always contemplated suicide but it's like a hazy thought, never actually thought much about it.

I seriously do not want to do it but I have gotten to a point where I just go on anymore, the pain is too huge, there is seriously nothing left for me. I have zero interest in school, absolutely struggling, grades turning into absolute shit, anxiety problems, social problems and even more. I really never thought I would get to so low but here I am now. I really do not know how to do it and I do not want to do it, but it is the better choice to do. Everything is shit and I have nothing left, I have tried so hard, I can't go on anymore.

I remember where I was standing in front of my house, looking around to see if anyone saw me, and, then, I started running towards the street; but, I stopped.

I kept it a really hidden secret for two years until I confided in a close friend about my cutting and about a beating I had received from my father.  That friend then called the cops, and they came over to my house.  I told them that my father didn't beat me because I didn't want to see him go to jail; they took pictures of my scars from cutting and threatened to take me away if I did it again.  After the cops left, I kept getting yelled at for being a stupid, ignorant bitch for getting my father in trouble like that and for doing those things to my body.  I can understand this view of things.  I really can, but the cutting, for me, is almost like an addiction.  It has been my only friend during my depression and sadness.  The release is almost euphoric.  And, just the thought of how wonderful harming myself feels, gets me excited for the release that I could feel from the pain of suicide.\n",

But, now, I was denied the ability to go to these colleges because my parents did not want me so far away.  And, even after going to a local college, I couldn't finish school due to finances.  That wonderful ex cheated on me with 5 girls in the time we were together and stole my virginity.  I can't even walk into my church for help in fear of getting excommunicated because I had sex with my ex.  My life is a complete waste now.

I used to be objective about suicide like “ i think being dead is much easier so it is a much more intelligent option to kill myself than to try living” .But now i just feel i can’t do one more day,  and days passes and i am still alive, and for some moments i even forget why i am sad, and then everythings comes back and i just can’t breath.It is really dificult everything, i am not even able to do simple tasks, and i think i might be developing some sort of ED . I am constantly fighting, with my parents (who i share a terrible relationship with but i am 15 so still live with them) , with the mirror, with school, with damn society, with memories.Specially memories as i have stopped talking to the most important persons in my life and now i really need them but i cant cause one was a boy which we were starting to share some feelings for each other but i got really scared and ghosted him , and the other is a sib which used to be a really close friend but them told me them loved me and well at once said that if i ever killed myself would kill also (what made me apart because...well it was toxic for them and is really better without me, now them is really better) .So as i was saying... i miss that two persons, really missing them. With the boy i still talk, he is coming back from his holidays in friday so i don t know if i will kill myself today or wait until then so i can hug him one last time (hugging him feels like heaven) . So... i am not really sure why i am writing this...just want to take it all out, but i hope you people are being able to better your lifes, don’t give up sometimes things are dificult but maybe if you just smile a bit longer ;D haha wishitwouldbethateasy xd it is normal that i am going to be dead and i am still worried about exams?school sucks.

I know that many of the tips I will list below are not possible when you are in a particularly dark place, but I thought I'd mention them anyway — perhaps something will be of help to you. Here are a few things that help me keep overwhelming bouts of anxiety and ideation at bay: \n",
      "\n",
      "* Push yourself to wake up a little earlier. Stretch slowly with deep breaths and take a walk around your neighborhood as the sky turns rosy-yellow. Try to appreciate the new day; think of something, anything, to look forward to. Return home for a  warm shower and freshly-laundered clothes.\n",
      "* Sleep a little bit earlier. Wash your sheets and buy a few soft blankets to make your bed into a cozy sanctuary. Allot time for reading or journalling to clear your mind.\n",
      "* Allot time to cook simple, lovely meals. Steam fresh vegetables, cook some rice, or cut up a fruit salad of apples, bananas, and citrus. Eat mindfully and drink plenty of water. \n",
      "* Buy a well-bound journal and a good quality pen. Write down achievable to-do lists, make calendars, note groceries, thoughts, haikus —  anything. Put your thoughts in ink; appreciate daily observations. \n",
      "* Reorganize your space, or at least a little section of it. Listen to a nice podcast as you do so. Put your sheets and pillowcase into the laundry. Clear out your shelves and drawers, sort through everything, and replace it all neatly. Light a lovely candle and add some fresh flowers. Open a window or two.\n",
      "* Buy or borrow a book on any topic which sparks even the slightest interest. Crocheting? Botany? Medieval history? Delving into a new topic just for the sake of it is worthwhile.\n",
      "* Embrace non-competitive hobbies. This is incredibly important in a product(ivity)-obsessed society which devalues craftsmanship and pure interests. Activities like the following enrich your daily life and force you to set aside some time away from mandatory tasks: needle-felting, gardening, writing (poems, books, articles, blogs), painting, photography, wood-whittling, typography, graphic design, etc. Ensure that whatever you choose, the hobby involves holding the  fruits of your labor in your hands. You do not have to be \"good\" at it –  this is not a career choice. Watching yourself grow and have fun with  it is success in and of itself.\n",

      "Cry in my room, lie to my parents that I'm fine and it's just a cold, cut myself, cry because of the pain and then go to sleep while they're there thinking I'm studying  \n",
      " Hopefully I'll die from the bleeding in my sleep because I don't want to watch them see me in that condition, as I have no idea how I'd hide my cuts... also I'm trying to push myself away from my father as much as humanly possible...he's been sleeping in my room in the other bed and I'll try to make some excuse  to get him to go in the other room, since I'd need some time to get used to self-harming and work on how to hide them\n",
      "suicide - Walking the lineI just want to fucking die. My girlfriend just left me under the pretense that she's holding me back from someone who can \"really love me\" after I asked that she be more present online (she would go off for like 4-5 days b/c of workload from school). I thought it was reasonable to request that she send a text or two a day just to let me know she's still there. Finally after about 3-4 weeks of this I blew up, unable to take it, unable to believe that she would be so unwilling to communicate if she truly loved me. It was then I realized she'd never really said it. Had ever said \"I love you.\" She revealed to me she had found it draining to talk to someone everyday for even the 2 months we had been together (one bullet to the chest). She told me (though I already knew, we'd talked about it at the beginning) that we had come into our relationship on different grounds: I was i love with her, and she was willing to give me a shot in spite of her history with abusive men. I was looking for a romantic relationship and she was looking for something only a bit above platonic. She enjoyed holding my hand, she said. She enjoyed our time together, she said. But somehow, she wanted to tell me she was holding me back from someone who can \"really love me\"??? I want her back. I told her that was alright, b/c I didn't want to sound like a douche. I want to chase her, but I don't feel comfortable doing that to her. I want to respect that is how she feels, but she's never really told me that she doesn't love me either. And I know that conclusion is brought about by wishful thinking but it IS true. And I want her back so bad. I want her hand in mine. I want her head resting on my shoulder again. And I had to see her again, at an organization we're both involved in. I didn't know what to say. Didn't know if she'd want me to say anything or if she'd want me to do something. So I said nothing. I stared at the ground and avoided looking at her. We usually always sat together. It hurt so bad. And then at the end, I see her walking briskly off into the night without a glance back, as if to say \"That's it. That's the last time you've screwed up. No more chances. We're through.\" And I almost cried right then and there in front of my fellow volunteers. I had to race off behind the building and bawl like a fucking baby. And I never fucking cry. I get angry instead. So I'm there behind the building crying, bashing the concrete walls with my bare fists, wishing I were just fucking dead.\n",

      "And on top of all this shit, my grades are abysmal even though I'm a top notch student. My parents hate me, hate who I am. And I've got a paper due tonight in my worst class (grade-wise) that could actually bring my grade back up to at least a B, and here I am fucking typing to random strangers on the internet about how much I want to kill myself. Maybe because I'm on the line between writing this next paragraph and running to a gun range and shooting myself in the head. \n",
      "suicide - We’re all going out tonight and I could overdose.Why shouldn’t I do it. I got involved with bad people, and I changed and pandered to them. People have a hard time looking at me now, my name has been smeared. Everyone knows my secrets. I know I should kill myself, I know it’s the right thing to do. But I’ve always been scared to. I had potential but now my life is over, I don’t see any point in trying. I’ll never get to be myself again. I was a virgin and my first partner destroyed all my self worth, i was always so scared to lose my virginity in case someone used it against me. And they did, and now I want to die. I’ve been away from that for a while now, and slowly trying to find myself again. Letting go of anger and shame is hard though. I just want to be myself again. I was nice, nobody was out to get me. I just liked playing Mario kart, and listening to music. I liked helping people who’d lost hope, talking to them and giving advice. I used to get random bursts of excitement, like anything could happen and I was ok. I’m going out tonight and Im sure I could overdose. I am broken, and every time I feel like I’m getting back to being myself again I’m torn back into the darkness. I think of death and I see the attraction. It’ll just be over. And what people think won’t matter, and my heart can finally rest. It won’t matter how dirty and broken I feel, I could be at peace.\n",

Others  who I wouldn't consider close started disrespecting me, treating me like a retard. I've had depression even before this started happen, but it only deepened my anxiety. I even got around cutting myself once. A friend saw these cuts, she said she would always be there for me, but she left me a long time ago. Remembering her promise to me made me sad, it made me think of all the things we did together, and all the thing we could have been doing this year. I fear that by next year I would be spending social night in the corner crying, or worse, in the bathroom cutting. Sometimes I lie awake at night thinking of how it would feel to jump of the roof of my house, or the school, or something even worse. I'm too scared to do it, but every night I stay up burning my youth away, it just keeps coming to me...\n",

That isn't true. I post things to get it out because if I don't it explodes and it ends up with serious consequences. I'm not faking. I think about it all the time. I'm even prepared for it. I've thought about how and when I would do it and I've thought about the words I'd leave behind for those who it would hurt. I fantasize about it every day. Yes I need help, I know I need help. I've sought it and I don't get it. I've tried to check myself into the hospital twice in the last three months and I just get turned away because they don't take me seriously either. Honestly I don't like the attention it brings. Who wants to be known as the depressing guy who always brings everyone down? The only reason I haven't and I don't go through with it is because I actually give a shit about the people around me. I know that I'm loved and cared for by a lot of good people even though sometimes I can't feel it and I don't think I deserve it. It really pisses me off when people want to tell me why I am this or that way and how I'm just an attention whore. If I wanted attention I'd go about it a different way and I damn sure wouldn't run around holding up a sign broadcasting my crazy. No one has any right to tell me or anyone else what I'm going through in my head because you don't know. You don't know my struggles and you don't know my thoughts.\n",

Everyone has a different thought pattern. We all have different demons and we all have different angels. So before you lay your experience over those of others and you discount someone else's pain because of your experiences with your own you should realize that it was your experience and not theirs. None of us have the ability to experience anyone else's experience. What you are seeing is nothing more than your own observations filtered through your own reality.\n",

She’s a much better person nowadays and would have done things differently, given the chance, but it’s just too late now.

I want to get married for real, get a degree, have kids and make money from home. Those were my only goals, but it’s too much to ask for my career level and education, an it’s just not in the cards for us as a couple. We don’t want any of the same things. I don’t want to exist anymore. I’ve lost control of my life. There’s nothing else for me to do but die. I just don’t want to be here anymore. It just seems so stupid to even try. I’ve always been an optimist and have never had suicidal tendencies before, and nobody has any idea that I’m even thinking of this, which would make it so easy.

I was always really interested in computers and science so I decided to go for a computer science a level as well as other a levels. However due to my c in maths and english this simply wasn't an option. I think this was the start of my depression, it was a hard pill to swallow. So I started a btec in computing, but it simply didn't engage me I just couldn't apply myself, so I dropped out, partially due to the mounting work I couldn't bring myself to do, I probably could've done it if I'd applied my self but regardless I fucked it up much like the GCSEs.\n",

      "I am 22. Throughout my childhood, I tried to get help but was ignored. I grew up home schooled my entire life, with a mother, father, and significantly older sibling. My mother was a diagnosed bi-polar with homicidal tendencies, my father is not diagnosed with anything, just... mean. My sibling took full advantage of the dawn of the internet and stayed off in their own world 90% of the time- I sort of did the same shortly before hitting puberty. We lived in a small house in a run down neighborhood, we were poor. Very poor. I slept on a floor most of my life, me and my sibling shared our bedroom. My earliest memories are painful. Being beaten by my mother when I was younger, screamed at and told how I ruined everyone in my family's life by existing. Around the age of 8, my mother stopped hitting me, my father started. By that point in time I had been sexually assaulted by relatives, but never told anyone a word of it. (And I wouldn't until I started dating, around 14.. I wanted my boyfriend to understand why I was against having sex. We dated until I was 20 and he had cheated on me numerous times, he had also beaten and raped me multiple times.) My mother had severe health issues, and from her genetics, as do I. My life expectancy extends into my fifties, something I have accepted at this point. I also have to have a hysterectomy soon due to severe endometriosis.\n",
      "\n",
      "That being said, things have gotten better. 2015 was a horrible, yet wonderful year. It brought change. I had finally gotten somewhat comfortable with my existence without my suddenly ex-fiance', a person who had convinced me that he was the only one who -could- love me. And, in the beginning of the year, I found out that my best friend from when I was 15 had moved back in town, having moved across the country years previously. We ended up dating, something which I am so very happy about, he gives me joy when everything else is dark. I lived in a terrible house, owned by my parents and only a block away from their home. Originally it was my siblings residence, and their ex had destroyed it while on heavy drugs. I was told I could rent to own the place, and that if I put repairs into it, to show receipts of the cost and it would be deducted from the rent. A pretty nice deal, it seemed to me. My alternative was outright being kicked to the street, since they needed my room for my sibling.\n",
      "\n",
      "My boyfriend moved in with me, took care of me and my health issues, and was more than willing to help with fixing the house while I would go to work. $15,000 spent on fixing the house, my parents stopped saying it was rent to own, and the reparations weren't counted with rent. My savings account was mostly depleted when my sibling told me my parents were planning on selling the house from under me if I kept fixing it. I was broke by this point, it was almost Fall, and my seasonal, almost minimum wage job was about to end. (I work an amusement park. Great place, for the record.) By this time, my boyfriend also worked there. Me and him started seriously talking about moving at this point. My family was verbally abusing me still, and was trying to control my every move. If I went longer than two hours without speaking to them, they would freak out. If I missed a single phone call, they would freak out. They had been raising how much I needed to pay them, knowing full well that I scarcely had money for bare minimum food. In early November of 2015, we moved in with my boyfriends family, and I have cut communication with my family entirely. They don't know my phone number or where I live. Originally, I tried to maintain contact, I hoped I could have a family relationship, that all I needed to do was move out of their control. Their harassment was daily, and it was getting harsher, and so I changed my phone number and blocked them on social media.\n",
      "\n",
      "My boyfriends family has been very kind and accepting of me, even with my health issues. The boyfriend himself has gone way above and beyond expectation. He and a friend of his are slowly beginning to teach me how to drive, since nobody had previously. I actually get two meals a day now, a place to live that doesn't have caked on grime and large holes in the walls, and my life doesn't feel threatened anymore. Hell, this is the best health and home I have ever experienced. But I feel like there are holes in my heart, and I feel such intense pain radiate from them.. I miss my mother the most, I think. I knew she was insane, literally, and I think that gave her an excuse in my mind. I still loved her. Even my sibling turned against me.. It hurts so much to think about. I typed this up today, because some days, frequently, I just break down crying anymore. The holidays hurt horribly, as well as my own birthday. If it weren't for my boyfriend, I would have gone back to cutting, and I would have killed myself. The thought still occurs, but I can't do that to him. I can't do that to the future I want to have with him. With spring approaching, I am about to begin my job at the amusement park again.. The problem is, my family can find me there. They knew I worked there, and they always get season passes. I tried to get a job elsewhere and nobody would hire me. This is my best chance, especially since I have a very slim chance at having transportation elsewhere. (Boyfriend has a different job, bus is out of the question) I just don't know what to do anymore. I don't know how to handle my emotions, my anxiety, what to do if my family finds and harasses me while I am at work.. I'm terrified. We're finally getting somewhere in life, but I have this horrible feeling that it's all going to crash around me if I am found. I'm sorry. I needed to talk to someone, I have very few friends, no family or relatives to speak with. I vent to my boyfriend of course, and he hears me out and reassures me.. But I feel like I need help.\n",

I clean the nasty fucking bowls, the nasty fucking plates, the NASTY FUCKING MUGS SHE USED AS BOWLS, everything. Now I’m already sick of all her shit. I ask her for her dirty dishes. She says “no.” So I’m like “it’s less work for me and less dishes for her. Fine” I continue doing the dishes.

      "Well, here's my backstory - 9yrs ago, I decided on career change and worked my ass off for 3yrs to get into grad school. I chose the wrong school and faculty hated me so much. 6months before I was set to graduate they kicked me out of the program for no good reason. I had a 3.78 GPA, I was finishing up my clinical rotations, but apparently they never planned on letting me graduate. A VP board member told me that it's common practice at their university for programs to keep students in the program as long as possible to make money off those students when they already know they don't plan on letting certain students they dislike graduate. They get away with it bc it's a religious private institution so they have so many loop holes. When the loopholes don't work, their power attorneys keep extending the trial until they bleed the students dry and former students trying to sue the school can no longer afford to pay attorney fees to continue fighting. I lost 7yrs of my life and came out of that school with PTSD, depression, and anxiety. I tried to kill myself 3xs while I was in the program, but each time I was brought back. I spent 2yrs trying to pull myself out of depression and not end my life. Things just barely started to get better this year. Then I got together with my boyfriend and at first it was phenomenal - but that only lasted 3wks. After that he started getting so temperamental with me and would lash out at me when things in his life stressed him out or he was having a bad day. Stupid me kept going back to him bc he'd apologize and give me so many empty promises. The last 2months were so tumultuous and now it's over bc I asked him a question. \n",

      "What do I have to live for? I have no support system. I don't really have friends, I don't have a relationship with my family except for my mom and she can be a real bitch. She calls me a loser for being hurt over this. I can't find a job bc I'm not qualified for anything. Companies find it suspicious that I have such a gap in work history, but I can't exactly explain to them that I went for a career change and that failed. That just makes me look even worse. And honestly, I've really wanted to find love more than anything. That's why I kept going back to my ex every time he apologized for lashing out at me or dumping me nearly every weekend. But this time he's done with me for good - which is a good thing bc I was becoming a door mat. I just feel like I don't fit in this world and I don't want to be in it anymore. 40yrs of my life so far have been a lot of tragedies, horrors, and messed up things. What do I have to look forward to? I'm too naive and stupid for this world. I'm not strong enough to continue on. They say you gotta love yourself, but how do you love yourself when no one's shown you what love is? My family never loved me and made it a point to let me know I was a burden to them growing up. I spent so much of my 20s trying to win their love and affection by paying their bills, fixing their credit, and taking care of them. When I fell into debilitating depression, suddenly I was the good for nothing child and loser. They say there's always someone in the world who loves you that you just don't know... I can honestly say, that's not the case with me. All my friends move on wtih their lives. They've all gotten engaged, married, or started a family and don't have time for me. I called the suicide hotline and the lady rushed to get me off the line and only made me want to end my life even more. I feel absolutely hopeless and empty inside. I'm in so much internal pain and heartbreak that I don't want to keep going. How do I stop this? What if the next 40yrs is even worse than my first 40yrs? I can't handle anymore trauma and bad crap. This world wouldn't notice if I was gone. I can't stop crying and wondering why I'm such a f\\*\\*\\*ing loser.\n",

I didn’t allow myself to be happy, and you being in my life made me happy anyways. So thank you so much for that, because I’m starting to let myself be happy again. When we broke up, I was obviously devastated. It hurt a lot, as breakups do. I closed down and that’s why I was so weird, couldn’t decide if I loved you or hated you or what. Then I wanted back together, which was me thinking selfishly about my own wants, not yours. I kept asking you how you were because if you were as sad as I was, I was terrified that you were gonna hurt yourself again, which would’ve just about killed me. But the time apart was healthy, and I can see it with a new light. I loved you, and still do, because you were my friend. So thank you for being a friend, thank you for breaking my heart, because I know now how to be better about them.

      "suicide - Just another fuck upI'm 19 years old and I've experienced symptoms of moderate depression for the past 6 or 7 years, but this summer, the symptoms got a lot more severe. I thought it was just seasonal and due to the fact that I didn't get to see many of my friends, so I was hoping it would be better when school started up again for me. It didn't, and now everything's going to shit. \n",
      "My credit load is over full time, I work 2 jobs to pay for school, rent, and my car, and I'm also working for two different professors. The only problem is, I have zero motivation to do anything anymore. Every little thing is so much more difficult now, be it trying to keep up my focus, or even smiling at my friends in passing. I don't have much of an appetite anymore, and because I can't sleep at night due to my stress level, I can barely force myself to wake up to go to 10am classes. On the rare occasions when I do muster up enough energy to go to school, I think about killing myself multiple times a day. I've forgotten nearly every ambition I had going into college and I can't imagine any sort of future for myself anymore.  \n",
      "I have no idea what the hell happened. Last year, I got a 4.0 both semesters and this semester, I'm about to fail three classes. If I fail, the financial stress it would put on me would be too great. After weighing my options, it seems like the only way out is if I die. Late last night, I spent 2 hours sitting on a high bridge over a river that runs through my campus. After talking myself into it, I climbed over the railing. I'm too much of a fucking pussy though, and I couldn't gather enough courage to actually jump off.\n",
      "Last night was fucking terrifying, but I know unless I get help, it won't be the last time I try to do that. I don't want to feel like this anymore. For the first time in my entire life, I'm admitting that I need help. I'm really scared, though, and I have no idea where to turn. I've been lying to doctors for years, telling them everything was okay because I was somehow managing to get by. I don't want my friends to know about this because I don't want them to be worried. My parents don't believe that depression is actually real, and whenever they've noticed how I feel, they tell me that I shouldn't feel sad and that life is just stressful.\n",
      "Maybe life is just stressful. But I don't think it's supposed to be this fucking miserable. But if this is how you're supposed to feel all the time, then I'm just not cut out for it. Maybe I'm just another fuck up and the world will be fine with out me.\n",

      "suicide - Im a cheater i deserve to dieI cheated on my gf with a guy cause i was too negative and made myself believe she was going to leave. I know it doesnt justify what i did nor am i trying to. We stopped talking for a while and i have been living with her for the past year. I really thought i could make it better since im the one who fucked it up. Shes been the only person who has been kind to me but cus im so fucked up i couldnt see it. This past year hasnt been that bad since most of the time she enjoyed my company and still could be affectionate but she makes it clear that shes not ok even if we have good days. I dont blame her. Im at that the point where i cant see her so hurt by my actions and im really thinking of just ending my life. I already did the worst think imaginable so killing myself doesnt feel that bad. Suicide is something that was always in the back of my mind for as long as i can remember and struggled with. I have tried a few times but then convince myself not to and cant go through with it but this time im ready. Ive tried reaching to the church, tried therapy and meds but nothing wont ever change what i did to her. She didnt deserve at all what i did but i cant undo it. Ive tried telling her how i would never do it again n believed this could be the turning point n be better but i know shes done which she has every right to. I was just so selfish for not being able to tell her and for believing she was bad. I realize only too late that she was just frustrated. When she tells me how i was acting its almost like it wasnt me. Everytime she remembers it just convinces me to just kill myself more and more. I wish i could just let her go but something tells me not to n at times feel it will get better for us n move forward in our relationship. But as of late i see her more hurt and unhappy and its all because of me. I think if i killed myself it would hurt her more but at the same time i feel it will give her peace to never see me again. I mean i already hurt her in the worst way so how much bad can this be? Its been a struggle to do it since i know her parents love me more than my whole family n dont want to make them sad but again i hurt them when i cheated on their daughter so i think they will be fine. Im trying to find reasons not to do it but nothing convinces me to stay. If she were to tell me not to i still think i would. Its just really makes me so sad to see her this way and its all my fault. Ive always been a fuckup and i know she deserves better. Im happy for the 5 years she allowed me to be in her life and can be at peace with knowing it was the best of life n just letting her go so she can finally be happy. I just know this is the best option but just want to plan it better so i dont fuck this up to. My best option is suffocation since i dont need anybody cleaning a bloody mess.

      "suicide - I am not sure anymoreI have no idea where to start as I've never really posted about stuff like this and I don't think it'll help, and I am not really looking for help either so. I've been just in general sad for the past year and a half, and it's starting to bother me. Back in elementary kids always used to bug me and just be assholes because I am legally blind in my right eye, and it was lazy, but that didn't bother me much. By sixth grade I've heard it all, even just basic comments like \"Look at me when you're talking to me\" and stuff like that. I got an eye surgery and that was that. My dad would drink often enough where he would make comments about it and stuff and it tore me apart. After the surgery it didn't look lazy anymore but I always check for it whenever I wake up just to see how it is. Then following that we had this big family incident where me, my sister, and my mom, did not speak to my dad for the span of a year. I've never been close to my dad but I just felt alone during this time and I still do. At school I got even more shit for another reason that will take to long to type, but I was lost and alone. I've got friends that I speak to but they all keep saying I should get help, and asking what is wrong with me, even though I don't know and it just makes me feel worse and worse every day. I also can't get into the career I like so I have that going for me. I feel like I would've just been over with it years ago if I didn't promise myself I would be a better dad than my dad is to me one day, but days like this I feel like I am going to break that promise.\n",

I was taken to an ER, where I could barely function out of pure stress. I tried to convince my mom that I would be fine if she supervised me while I'm at home, and that a hospital wouldn't help me at all and would only make me more stressed. She tried to cooperate with me and the social worker, and everyone agreed that I could go home if I was intensely supervised, which even meant someone had to sleep in my room with me.

      "non-suicide - i got lost in the forest for 5 hours ok so for context i live in the buttfuck middle of nowhere and my family owns a fairly large piece of property that is mostly woods (a bit over 50 acres). I'm bored so I decide it might be a good idea to just walk around the border of the property which is \"well marked\" by an old stone wall. I start walking around and it goes well at first. I reach the first corner of the square shaped piece of land with minor difficulty since the stone wall isn't as intact as I thought it was. The next side of the square goes even smoother than the first, with the stone wall being almost fully intact. The third side is where things really get rough. Now me, being a complete dumbass, decided not to bring my phone, nor tell my parents that i was going on this walk, and all i have to tell time is my fitbit, so by now it has already been about two hours. going down the third side of the property I quickly lose track of the crumbling stone wall and end up having to pretty much guess where to go, I should have turned back here. I walk through the woods for about another hour and then realize that based on my previous times, I probably should have gotten back to the fourth side (the road) by now. I keep going hoping that i was just going a bit slower. Soon I hit what appears to be a path, which I had never seen before when walking out here with my dad. I walk down it a little ways and then end up in a grove of trees, at this point I decide to go back to my route, since at this time I still believed that at this time I was going the right way. I intersect with a few more of these paths along my walk, and begin to get worried, both because I have never seen this before, and because it will soon be dark (it is a bit after 4 pm at this time). Eventually I hit another one of these paths and decide that my best course of action is to follow it, hoping that it will lead to a road. The path ends up being quite long and splits off into many branches, I just keep going straight. By this time it is really starting to get dark, although I can still see. I finally reach the end of the path and what is see is some spooky looking old run down cottage. With me being a curious mf, I decide to take a peek in, since it doesn't have any lights inside of it. The door is made out of rotting plywood and I open it up. Looking inside there is pretty much nothing besides a step-ladder in the corner and a hole in the floor. Seeing that there's nothing going on, I leave. (Not exactly the spooky cottage you were probably hoping for, but that's how it was) I keep going on the paths and it eventually reaches a road, which I recognize as my neighbor's long driveway, I run down it and back up the road to my house in the dark. Not too exciting, but it was quite fun finding my way out and I was pretty spooked by the old cottage at first. \n",

Everyone is on fb, everyone sees the birthday notification, but they chose to not even say a word. I know this sounds so stupid and whiney but its just like solidifies the idea that i dont matter.

Not a word about me or my sister. She knew wed see it obviously if we have her on fb. Not even the person who gave birth to me can remember i exist. All I am good for is being used occasionally.

I want to end my life so bad, i feel like looking up suicide methods is so so comforting because its like i know there is a way to escape. I know i am stupid and people hate me because i have no reason to feel this way but it only makes me want to end it more. There is no help I can get, ive done it all.

      "suicide - Disease has destroyed my lifeSo, about me...I’m a 27 year old man. I live in a city and work at a good company. I was diagnosed with Wegener’s Granulamatosis at 18. When I was first diagnosed, the only permanent damage was slightly done to my nose and some nerve damage with one of my feet. I still looked like my normal self. I went into full remission soon. Full Remission lasted until the spring/summer of 2017. I had the option to take a new drug  approved for the disease in 2016 called Rituxan, but refused because of overplayed internet horror stories. I was an attractive man during remission. I took different girls out every weekend. I had a great life, family, job &amp; friends. I started feeling bad this spring so my doctor upped the drugs I was on but I still went into an acute phase of Wegener’s by the end of the summer. The bridge of my nose has collapsed, I have no septum. I constantly cough up post nasal. Also as complications of the flare, pachymeningitis, and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis was found via MRI. I took the rounds of Rituxan at the end of August but the damage had been done. I was supposed to be scheduled in June but no one reached out to me until July. My doctor was furious. I also have bilateral proptosis (both of my eyes are bulged out of socket). Optic nerve edema has caused alternating estropia in my eyes. I also have more nerve damage and my teeth are rotting away from high prednisone usage along with cushingoid face. I’m a physical train wreck. I was an attractive, confident man, people loved being around me. Watching my face fall apart as I can do nothing to stop it has ruined me psychologically, along with the constant headaches. The disease has completely destroyed my life. I look like a completely different person. I’m now an alien in my own body. I avoid all public places and have no future possibility at a normal social or dating life ever again. I still work, but I’m severely depressed. Most of the physical damage done to my face will never resolve. And I can’t have reconstructive surgery because the risk of the disease coming back and just destroying the work is high. There was a 50/50 chance it would never come back. I failed that test horrendously. I want out. I don’t want to live this life. I’m a completely different person now, inside and out. I have nothing positive to look forward to. I don’t know who to talk to about it. My parents are tired of me talking about it. I understand, I’m a constant negative in anyone’s life. And that’s how things are going to be from here on out. I may be willing to send pictures of how different I look....I don’t know how to move on from this \n",

      "suicide - My story of depression and anxiety - suicide attemptsI am not entirely sure where to post this except here. Here is my story I am 26 years old. I was with someone for 3 years and was planning to propose on our 3rd year anniversary, unfortunately he broke up me before our anniversary date. The aftermath was complete shit, I made every possibly mistake in the book, on what not to do to get an ex back. After 1 month of the BU I made my first suicidal attempt. 4 to 5 months later, which is 3-4 weeks ago (timeline is pretty much a blur for me) I made a second attempt on my life which led me to be hospitalized for several hours under suicide watch. Officially today, I started taking anti-depressants. I do not regret trying to take my own life because I created such a horrible car wreck between my ex and myself that I no longer want to live with that guilt. Regardless if my intentions were good or not. I still made some bad choices, but I don't think my suicide attempt was one of them. Few days till now, I was planning to do another suicide attempt. I have two plans in mind, but I haven't done anything to put it into action. I'm just only thinking about it. Each day becomes harder than the next. My ex's last words would forever resonate within me. I visited my ex home unannounced about 4 times. I would send him text that I am coming. Then show up in front of his doorstep. During those 4 times he would accept me into his home and we would talk. Most of the time, we ended up having sex. Which made things incredibly worse for me. After my second attempt in suicide. I tried going over to his house again, he said he will call the police. Over the past 3 weeks, I would hear him and his friends youtube/twitch stream talk about me. Not very positively. I can avoid watching or hearing whatever him and his friends are saying. The point is I left such a negative mark on someone I cared about the most. I feel guilty, ashamed, not worthy of much. His friends tell me, he just wants to move on, us go our separate ways, but one thing that will always carry me is his last words to me. I will never be able to forget that. That is what is still pushing me to think of suicide. That feeling of being seen as a bad guy. Being seen as a crazy ex gf. Hurts me incredibly. My ex isn't a bad person. However, speaking to his friends about my side of the story makes me feel like I am. I am no longer speaking to his friends. However, my ex's words and his friends words are still in my heart and in my mind. I still want to end my life. Ending my life means no more responsibilities, no more anxiety, no more overthinking, no more heartache, and I no longer have to carry this horrible memory of what I have done to push my ex so far. I just want the pain to end. I just want to forget. I want unhear what he said about me, I want to be left alone. I deserve happiness, yet it has not arrived to my doorstep. I just want everything to standstill for just a moment so I can scream and cry. Have no one judge me for crying and feeling the way I feel. I feel so utterly lost, hurt and misunderstood. My whole being right then and there died with me on my first attempt. I no longer remember who I was before. Please help, I am seeing a psychiatrist and therapist. I began taking my anti-meds today. I just feel so lost and hurt. I feel ashamed of my actions after the break up. If I didn't push my ex so hard and seemed so desperate, I probably would be talking to him today.   \n",

Medicine helps me to not hit rock bottom but also makes me just a piece of meat that breaths by default.  I’m unemployed, living in a country full of violence, corruption and hunger.  No opportunities for me since I’m in terrible debt, with not a single penny in bank account.  With a bachelors and an associate degree I feel the most useless human being on earth. Worthless. Deep down in my heart I really don’t want to die, but I can’t withstand any more suffering, I’m tired. I really didn’t want to bothered those few around me with all my crap anymore so maybe someone hear wanted to share some time with me. Maybe someone can share some hope\n",

I work in a hospital currently during the pandemic and I have no fear at all towards the virus. I constantly when I get a symptom of anything serious look it up to see if I have an terminal Illness and this may sound weird but I hope that I do, I think this may be due to the fact it could end my life without people having to question anything. I can’t help but feel selfish as I know people care about me yet I feel lonely. I feel extremely guilty for how I feel as I know people suffer much more everyday.

We'd had quite a history previously, but had never dated until that point. I loved everything about her, and I felt completely comfortable around her, as though I could tell her anything. The first 4 months were wonderful, but then she turned emotionally abusive and manipulative, and transformed into a compulsive liar. She left by becoming pregnant with another man's child. To say the least, my emotions were battered and trampled beyond recognition.\n",

So, I saw her just last night, again. I asked her if she remembered our conversation from August, and she said yes, and that she was sorry for being so rude last August, but that, at this point in time, she's \"not interested in a relationship\" and \"satisfied with personal growth.\" I was so crushed, that I didn't have anything else to say.

My sister was with me. 3 hours later my dad comes to pick us up. This was strange... it was only 3 or 4 in the afternoon and he doesn't get off work/home until 6.

He taught me how to flick a bottle cap a hard enough to make a dent in the wall.  He taught me how to put cigarette loads in my moms cigarettes to make them explode. He took me camping.

I've been fairly good about not self harming to a degree that will permanently scar or damage me but I don't know how long I can keep that up. Mental health only seems to matter to people when suicide becomes a threat or after a suicide has taken place. I've isolated myself, started self harming, and nobody fucking know. Not a single person in my family knows or even suspects anything. I'm in my room \"doing work\". The reality is that I spend my day feeling shitty and getting nothing done, going to bed at 12AM, waking up at between 2AM and 5AM and getting all my work done before school. This has been my mode of life for the past four weeks. And nobody knows. I'm that good at hiding this shit. So when is it going to matter? I've almost been able to trick myself that I'm doing fine. People ask how I'm doing and it's goddamn robotic at this point; \"good, you?\". So I'll just wait until suicidal ideation turns into suicidal tendencies huh? Maybe I'll figure out what I'd do if I do become suicidal. It seems strangely comforting to know that I would have a way out if it gets that bad.\n",

We met when I was 16 and she was 15... We were best friends and I thought we were going to be together forever. While our relationship wasn't perfect, it was mainly great- we both had our insecurities but it was manageable. We moved in together in college, but I changed for the worse.\n",

As I was recovering I started to have a tremendous amount of regret revolving around my suicide attempt because my situation seemed to be getting better and I had hope for the future. I later realized that I'm just a attention-seeking asshole, and that's why I regretted my attempt.\n",

I literally ruined my own life (and hers) by being unhappy. Having no contact with someone who you considered to be your best friend hurts like crazy and just to know there is some other guy in the picture hurts my heart so fucking much. I also hate how much I must have scared my ex. Something I can never forgive myself for. This unhappiness just causes more unhappiness-- and I need to end this negative feedback loop. My major depressive disorder, the breakup, and the constant thought of suicide has caused me to drop out of college.\n",

Over the past year I've noticed more and more depression in me. I've never been to the doctor for it, because I'm afraid of what my parents would say if I told them. Probably laugh it off. My 18 year old brother has depression, OCD, ADD, and a mental disability from drugs. Anyways, recently my life has been going downhill and I'm depressed most of the time out of the week. The only thing that cheers me up is my SO. I know I'm only 14 but she's that special person to me. It's been nearly 8 months and that's a lot longer than most high school relationships, so I'm proud. She's literally everything I live for...and the reason I'm alive. She has depression too and we help each other as much as we can. If I didn't have her, I probably would of killed myself by now. I have a total of maybe 5 friends, and I feel like my family hates me. Like they don't even love me. I hide in the safety of my room because it's always something with me when I'm around them. Just this morning, 10 minutes after I woke up, my mom barged in screaming at me because I was an inconvience to her. I try to do good in school, but it's hard when there's no one to talk to...when there's a group project and you're that one kid who sits in the corner doing it by himself. Today I took one of my knives (I'm a collector) and scraped it against my skin. Not enough to bleed, but enough to leave that white, painful line.

Mom does not share that logic though. She wouldn't be happy that I don't suffer here anymore. She would only think about her feelings - that's normal, that's human.

However lately this sensitivity has (hopefully) come to its peak, it being the most sensitive it's most likely ever been for me. I don't get if it's my loss of childhood, lack of a normal childhood, the fact of my innocence having been taken at an early age, or what else it may be, but the sensitivity to innocent and cute things has been within me for a decent while now. It fucks with me the most. The smallest thing can send me into the deepest depression. That sentence doesn't even just apply to the sensitivity to innocence and such, actually.

I know that it was completely his fault for driving drunk, but I don’t think that he deserved to have his life taken away for makign a few bad decisions. He was 17. I knew that he was having trouble withalcohol, but I didn’t do enough, and I’m sorry for that, Evan. I just feel lkie  I could have tried to help him, or have gotten him help. He was a good guy- pretty good grades, his girlfriend really loved him, and he helped out at the community center when he could. I just don’t understand why god would let this happen. Evan was one of the best people I ever knew, so why was he taken away? Why wasn’t I? I mean, I don’t do anything good for anyone around me, but Evan did. I just wish that I was in the car, not him. He was there for me when I was being stupid. Why wasn’t I ther for him? And now I’m just thinking thhat Evan wouldnt have let me think like this. He would always cheer me up when I was sad.

He'd text this friend and they would meet him as soon as he could get away from me so he could tell them about the abuse-- except, he'd tell it from *my freaking side.* None of his friends ever wanted to hear a word I said, of course, including the one who came with him to get his things to physically intimidate me, had my ex lie to me that he'd come in alone and then the friend threatened me with the cops if i didn't let them in too; because by the time I realized how many people physically near us that he'd gotten in on his story, he'd had *months* with them. When I asked him a few months ago to stop posting online about it or about me he simply challenged me to make a post correcting him, knowing that I already had to delete all my social medias to keep the people who hated me, laughed at me, some who even wanted me dead, from telling me so, or having any more \"ammunition\" (anything I posted that they found *cringey).* \n",

      "suicide - idk what to do so might as well kms xdi've been suicidal for the past few years of my life and i'm only 15. i've attempted a few times by overdosing and trying to cut my wrists but nothing has worked. my suicidal thoughts have only been getting worse and overwhelming and i don't know what to do. a couple of weeks back i was also raped by a friend and i fell pregnant. my parents aren't aware of this and i've had to deal with the abortion all by myself. the only person in my family i told was my cousin, who helped me alot. i told friends i went with school with recently as we had an argument and i've been acting really off. they've all unfriended me and kicked me out of all their group chats and whenever i message them, their replies are really dry and off, and that just tells me they don't want anything to do with me. my so called best friend sent me this message yesterday and i cried so much;- \n",

I'm even failing majority of my school exams and I have some next half term as soon as I go back to school. I have nothing to lose anymore so I don't know what's stopping me from killing myself. My school friends would just be sad about it for like a day or two and move on and idc what they think because they all have a bad image of me anyways, but the thought of leaving my family just really upset me last night but it's something i've got to do. i can't go on another day. as each day progresses, the walls keep caving in on me and it's as if i've got nowhere to go. later on today i'm going to try and get some sleeping pills and take them with some codeine, ibuprofen, naproxen and any other pills i can get hold off and try and suffocate myself in my sleep. however i doubt i will be able to go out today so i'm going to try myself to do so in the next week. i already stayed up until 3am last night writing my suicide letter. i've come to realisation that no matter what i'd do in my life, i'm never gonna be happy and no one will ever like me for who i truly am. my gf is only with me because she pities me. i'm never going to be enough for my family due to the fact i'm gay. i haven't come out to them yet ebcause being gay is a sin and seen as something bad in our religion and culture and in their culture they want me to get married in my early twenties, after i've graduated and have kids and just be a slave to him and patriarchy which i don't want. i want to focus on myself, have a career i want to and not be forced to go into medicine which i have no interest in. the things that used to make me happy was making youtube videos under this character i made and make music but i've lost all motivation to do so and it seems all my life is revolved around is exams and school. i'm sick and tired of everything and i just want to end it all.\n",

      "My childhood was okay. My dad was an asshole. So I don’t even want to talk about him. Honestly, the only good memory I have of my childhood was with my grandma. To me, she was the best grandma I could have asked for. I remember she always wanted to go to her homeland in china. But due to her bad legs, she wasn’t able to travel. When I was around 10 years old, my mom, my sister, and I left for America. We basically left my grandma. In the end, she didn’t get to go to her homeland. She died 5 years after we left for America. The funny thing is I didn’t even shed a tear. I don’t really know why. I thought I loved her very much. I guess I’m just a terrible grandson…\n",
      "\n",
      "My life in America wasn’t so bad. At least, my dad isn’t here. Elementary school was fun. I made a few friends. At around 6th grade, my friends and I started to play a game call Runescape. That game wasted 3 years of my life. God, I hate that game. I introduced Runescape to my sister. She became addicted to it, and she never stops playing since. I am pretty sure I ruined her life with that game. Needless to say, my social life sucks. I never really have a girlfriend. Surprisingly, it doesn’t really bother me as much as most people. I had about 3 close friends when I was in middle school. When high school started, my three close friends and I decided to start doing drug. It was nothing too dangerous though. One day, my friends managed to get a drug called DMT, a strong psychedelic. The day we did DMT was the day I realized that I wasn’t afraid to die. While I was tripping on DMT, I felt like I was dying. I guess it was a bad trip or something. At one point, I thought I did die. I saw myself on the floor, lifeless. And I was okay with it…\n",
      "A year later, one of my closest friends started to lose it. His girlfriend dumped him, and he became extremely depressed. He stopped hanging out with us. I knew he was drifting away from us, but I did nothing. I just pretend to not notice. I just didn’t know what to say to him. Maybe that’s just an excuse I made up. I don’t know. Maybe I just didn’t care enough to help him. Eventually, he dropped out of high school. I did go to his house after that to try and talk to him. He didn’t let me in though. So I stopped going. Eventually, I lost contact with the guy. As his closest friend, I didn’t try hard enough for him. I guess I was a pretty terrible friend…\n",
      "\n",
      "Before I knew it, it was time to apply for colleges. I didn’t apply to any. It wasn’t because I didn’t want to. I was just too scared to do it. Throughout most of my life so far, I have been living day by day. I never thought of my future. So I didn’t really know what major I want to go into, or which colleges I want to go to. I also have nothing to write in my personal statement, because I have done nothing. So in the end, I ended up in a community college. \n",
      "Ever since I started school, I always thought I was smart. It was the only thing I thought I was good at. My grades in school were always A’s, with an occasional B’s. But now that I am in a Community College, I realize I am not smart at all. I am in the process of failing two of my classes: Physics II and Calculus 3. Believe it or not, those classes really open my eyes.  Now I know that grades don’t mean shits. Having a good grade doesn’t mean you are smart. It just means that you are willing to do the works. To be honest, I always knew I wasn’t smart. I just never wanted to admit it. I guess I was lying to myself in order to feel good about myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sometime around my high school years, I started to think about how I’m going to end my life. I decided I’m going to do it when I’m 21 years old. And it is going to be on Oct. 13th.  I still haven’t decided on how I am going to do it through, or where I am going to do it. Should I let people find my body, or should I do it at a place where people can never find me? Also, should I leave a note or something? All those questions are running through my head every day. Without realizing it, I have managed to drive away all of my friends. If you think about it, it isn’t so bad since I am planning a suicide anyway. So now, I have 0 friends. In other word, the only people who will miss me when I’m gone are my sister and my mom. Now here is the problem. I don’t want to do this to them. But, I can’t take it anymore. Like most mothers, my mom wants my sister and me to have a bright future. She worked so hard to try and make that happen. Believe it or not, I only had only one goal in my life up until now. I just wanted to repay my mom for what she has done for me. But now I feel like I can’t achieve that goal.  So every times I look at her, I feel guilty. I don’t see myself having a bright future. And I hate to say this, but I don’t see my sister having one either. In the end, it is my fault that my sister became like she is now. Undoubtedly, I am a terrible brother and an awful son…\n",
      "\n",
      "These past few months, my suicidal thoughts have become more frequent. Every time I get into my car, there is a feeling in the back of my mind of wanting to ram my car into a concrete wall or something. I feel like I am slowly going insane. There are different scenarios running inside my head almost every day. The thought of how I am going to do it, the thought of where I am going to do it, the thought of a fail suicide, and the thought of what will happen to my family when I am gone.  Most of those thoughts aren’t scary for me. But there is one that terrifies me.  A few weeks ago, a thought came across my mind. It was a thought of killing myself along with my family so that they don’t have to suffer pain of losing me; So that my mom wouldn’t have to deal with the embarrassment of having a son that committed suicide; So that my sister wouldn’t have to be a failure. But obviously, that is selfish and wrong in so many levels. The fact that a thought like that even crossed my mind proves that I am fucked up. A few more months left before I turn 20. Thus, I have about 1 years and a half left before Oct. 13th. I have to make my decision by July, 2017. That will leave me 3 months to plan if I do decide to take the easy way out. \n",

      "I have been contemplating suicide for years now. I've ideated plans involving pills, jumping off of buildings and other tall objects (in one instance ending up on top of one, and feeling no urge to jump), and now suicide by multiple gunshots, namely, one to the chest, hopefully piercing my heart, and one to the head following that, shooting myself in the heart to inflict a fatal wound that I could potentially muster some amount of effort to double the fatalness via a second shot to the head. This would be accomplished by calmly a cheerfully accompanying my brother to a shooting range such as he frequents with his girlfriend's father and her, and by telling her father that I'd like to shoot this time (following up on me turning down his previous offer to let me shoot some during my first visit to the range). I'm sleep-deprived and have been drinking way too many caffeinated drinks daily for way too long to get much needed good rest that I need, tonight. Through the processes of introspection, contemplation, meditation, psychedelic experiences, etc., I've been able to identify a pattern in all of this, namely that these kinds of thoughts occur more often when I am sleep deprived. I tell myself that I end up feeling this way because I feel trapped in a cycle of sacrificing time to employers for survival, sacrificing energy to things I do not care about at all, losing the precious time I have in this life to do what I truly care about doing and would willingly do as much as I physically can, every day, were I able to forget about performing actions to trade for menial income from employers who have no empathy and no reason to care enough to help materially free me from these cycles, partially because they have probably been caught in the same sorts of cycles themselves for very long times.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I could theoretically kick caffeine tomorrow, but do not want to, because I am obsessed with achieving lifelong material abundance as quickly as possible. I have thoroughly convinced myself through much introspection, daydreaming, journaling, experience (normal, meditative, and psychedelic), etc., that the only way to solve the problems through doing so, through performing some sort of master-stroke of an action that nets me all of the exchange power (money) I will ever need for literally everything I will do in this life. So, I feel like I cannot let up even for a single day to rest, and this feeling has expanded into feeling like I'd rather just never participate in any holidays, birthdays, or any other sort of cultural/national even of the like, because participation in such things disrupts my workflow, which is suboptimal. It's even gotten to the point where I have imagined breaking up with my loving and intelligent and wonderful significant other, and have contemplated that I might only be staying with her for potential future material gains and minor present benefits. tldr; I have convinced myself that having all the money and resources in the world, RIGHT NOW, is the only way I can solve my problems for good, and I continually attempt to actualize that moment, producing a track-record of continually failing.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And if I didn't already say it, on top of all of that, it feels like no one cares. I feel like empathy is a worthless emotion until some kind of material help has been actualized in reaction to that empathy. Or in other words, I don't need your pity or your empathy, I need your goddamn money. Right now. I've even been contemplating conversations with employers and interviewers where I lay all this out on the table for them, for example, \"I don't give a damn about your business, I am just here to perform actions in exchange for your cash, and if I could, I would liquidate your entire business right now and take all of the profits for myself. So, fucking hire me, train me to do the highest paying jobs in your place, and let me finish those jobs faster and more effectively than anyone you have ever known, NOW, so I can fucking leave this hellhole of a probably environmentally destructive institution, please.\" And on top of all of that, even I have begun to stop caring about the things I once thought I cared about, especially the moral imperatives presented by climate change and environmental destruction. I find myself slipping further and further into daydreams about prominent figures in cross-hairs and extreme accelerationist activities that softly speed the world into the destruction it is already headed for.. And the best I can contemplate doing when I feel this way is to aggressively make everyone's lives I can less enjoyable by transferring my plight and \"negative\" viewpoints and emotions and experiences and crises onto as many people as I can, because if someone else is in crisis then no one should be able to live a happy life until no one is in crisis. And even furthermore, I feel like I can't talk to anyone close to me about any of this, and that I'm probably likely to get my IP flagged (if it already hasn't been) by prominent authorities. The list goes on and on and on.   \n",

      "but in this conversation another person outside of me had sexual relations with me, I swear that I did not want to, I was afraid but at that moment I did not know what to do, I was totally out of my mind, mad and he knew it, even so. person thought that there was a kind of relationship similar to a Sugardaddy or something like that but it was totally wrong, he did it all the time against my will and acambio to shut up threatened me with my family or gave me money that was desperate for have, the point is that when my life started to go better he noticed and I told him that I would forget,  \n",
      "everything he had done to me but to leave me alone now, I could not bear to have to do that; cheating my family, my boyfriend, my friends ... \\(at this point he had already manipulated me to a point where he made me feel that in reality everything had been my fault, that I provoked him and that he did not say anything Because I liked it when seriously and I swear I never wanted to, the type of physical contact was already violent, I cried begging him to leave me in all the times he did it, I did not like it and he kept telling me that it was my fault ...  the point, that when in some magical way he left me, I suddenly returned annoyed because I had left, he told me that he had seen the face of a fool, that all the time I mocked him and it was not fair, so he agreed again to have something with him or pay him everything he had given me in exchange for shutting me up, I had no major problem because what I did not want was to have more conflicts with him, so I told him I would pay him but he wanted me to I left in peace, he made a sum too much money for what I could give him, he has a lot of money, I would never need what he was asking me so I knew that he did with the intention that he would have sex with He did not agree anyway, however the threats against me and my family started if he did not make a decision, he showed me pictures of my nude that he took when he was unprepared and he promised to show them if he did not pay. The guilt and the memory of everything that has made me spend these months is unbearable, I can not stand looking in the mirror and not feel disgusted by everything he did, if I did not say anything was because of everything he knew about me. and from my family, I feel that it was all my fault, I can not stand it anymore remember how many times I raped, I mocked and made me feel that everything was my fault. It will sound very ridiculous my situation compared to many who could enotrarse in this site but I can not stand it anymore, he has done me the worst I could have imagined, I finish with all my spirit of a girl of only 18 years with desire to do many projects, I can not anymore, I do not really want to continue with this disgusting feeling of horrible memories, I get tired, I have now no reason to follow every day with that memory while everyone tells me to forget it, I can not, I do not I can forgive and the guilt of having let me manipulate consumes me. I already tried to kill myself but my sisters and my boyfriend could say that they are my only reasons that stop me but days like today, days where the fear of seeing him again and hurting me, where the thoughts of how he raped me so many times and I just I was crying waiting for everything to end ... days like that they are consuming me all the time along with the desire to commit suicide, I do not want more, seriously I do not want more ... \n",

My parents weren’t home until recently, so when I would go home for the weekends, I would be alone and so I would stay for sometimes a week or more. I know I need to stay at school to “immerse” myself, but it’s really hard rn with covid to meet people, and 95% of my classes are online. When I’m home, I dread going back to school, and when I’m at school, my depression gets 10x worse. My parents have made a deal with me that I can come home every weekend if I work Saturdays but I just want to stay at home all the time because there’s no point in me even being at school. I feel like I was not ready at all for college because I was ripped away from the rest of high school in March and didn’t really get closure, and I’ve been with my family constantly since then, so it’s a lot harder to leave them than I thought it would have been under normal circumstances. I have severe anxiety and part of that is separation anxiety, so I would have had problems going to college anyway. I’m only 1.5 hours from home and I have a car, but my parents don’t seem to understand that maybe the best thing for me isn’t being forced to stay at school. I’m planning on becoming super involved once everything is closer to normal maybe next semester, but for now I just want to be at home. Don’t get me wrong, I enjoy the classes, I just hate being at school. I hate it so much that even though I enjoy the work, I would rather drop out than be at school, even though that’s something I wouldn’t do because I need a degree.

I was medicating myself with marijuana illegally and when I got into trouble I had this \"awakening\" or whatever and started to stay away from it. The downside of medicating yourself is that the emotions or feelings that you would have normally felt was all suppressed by the intoxicating effects of happiness from the weed.

Please don't give me a hate speech about this, and judge me for it, I didn't mean for it to happen but it was a trigger to my CPTSD and I had lost function of thinking before action and I had reacted. I know it wasn't hard, I apologized and she even said it wasn't hard and that it just startled her. But it startled me to because I am a firm believer in men should not hit women and I had just broken it. \n",

      "We talked about my CPTSD and I explained everything that I was going through. She had asked me to go to a therapist and my reaction to it was why would I want to talk about rape to a stranger when it was hard enough trying to talk to you about it. Not just one rape, years worth of rape, not by a stranger but by a family member. And the thing is, is at this time there was no such thing as a boy getting raped or at least not talked about. Like if it happens, then a boy should just keep his mouth closed about it, and that's exactly what I was taught by my family. Like that trauma doesn't matter to a boy. It's just all effed up.  So anyways, I decided the therapist and told her my reasons and she insisted that I go, and every fight this was brought up. How me and my \"abuser\" should just go F\\*\\*\\* each other using perfume (thats how it happened) and it's a constant trigger. \n",

      "So here we are talking about triggers, and you remember what happened with the first trigger, so know you probably want to ask if have I hit her more than once. Yes, I have. Because of verbal? No. All my physical abuse towards her was caused by physical abuse towards me. There was once that I saw her left leg jump up, almost like she was going to knee me in my groin, and in response, I had kicked her leg. If you are a guy, you know if a girl is going to knee you, you lift your leg in a way to cover yourself. My leg did that but mine reacted in a different way and made contact. Did it hurt her, yes it did and I spent the whole weekend holding and crying with her trying to apologize. Again, this was horrible and this is why I remember details about it. If I didn't care then I wouldn't remember. So we talked about seeing a therapist and I agreed. \n",

Never helped with laundry, never did anything to support me. She ended up fighting with me and threw urine on me. Pulled down her pants, cupped her hand, urinated, and threw it in my face. Practically because I wanted to go to sleep. Now I know what your thinking, but I'm actually proud of this knowing that my emotions have just effed with me when it comes to this girl.

It's like, I was raped 100s of times, beaten thousands of times, and verbally assualted millions and you want the easy way out? She has done this a lot throughout our relationship and at first I was like don't do it, you are worth more than that, and after the 6th or 7th time it was more like, stop saying that sh\\*\\*. Well again, months later she threatened it and ran into the bathroom. This was a scare tactic cause thats just how she plays her game, been through it 100s of times with her at this point and I just lost it. I gave it back to her. I pretended to swallow a 500 count of IBu and she called the cops on me. At that point, everything checked out that I was okay but they sent her to the mental hospital for having razor indents on her skin where she tried to cut. I moved back home. \n",

And it was just a constant fight about moving and I would continue to say no because of my mom. Well my mom ended up having a stroke and she still asked when I was moving. While my mom is locked in a coma, can't breath on her own, she wants to talk about moving? I found it very disrespectful for the situation. Well, short story, my mom passed and she continued to asked when I was moving.

I agreed that the baby could keep her last name, even though its against almost everything I believe in, I agreed on not going to court, I agreed on everything that she asked, even no visitation since we live in different states. But not signing the birth cert on a child? That's like a last straw for me. She agitates my CPTSD with comments about it, agitates fights, constantly downs me, then says that I can't be on the birth cert. I'm devastated. And now, I'm writing this because I really feel like its the end. My family wants me to fight for custody now, and I'm against taking children away from moms but they are being very hateful about my decision and are threatening CS to get involved resulting in the child not being in either arms. Its like wtf. So I'm thinking, if I'm out of the picture, what fuel do they have? They can't hurt my boy, I don't have to worry about a name, the mother gets what she wants, everyone wins, and I just sleep for a long time. Which I like sleeping, its like my most favorite time because I can be whoever I want to be and do whatever I want to do. And when I'm awake, I have to deal with this sh\\*\\*, people playing with my mental condition and not caring knowing that it exists. Taking advantage of me because I have a huge heart.

He walked away. I thought I was safe. He came back with his gun, the service weapon he carried for his job. I couldn't move. I didn't realize that my pelvis was broken, I just knew that I couldn't move. I laid there, only kind of able to see through the film of blood covering my eyes. He was pointing the gun at me. I'm not even religious and don't even have a solid understanding of christianity but I remember pleading with God in my head to let me live through this. I would give anything, do anything. I didn't want to get beaten and gunned down on the kitchen floor of my own apartment. I laid there in silence for what felt like an eternity. I heard the gun go off, I closed my eyes and for a second I actually thought I was dead. I just heard crashing and crashing. I was so shaken up that I actually felt like I was falling out of my body.

I don't feel loved. If you still care, then please show me. But it just got worse. “You need to love yourself first, before you expect others to love you. You have to be able to stand on your own feet. You depend too much on me. What would you do if I had an accident and died tomorrow? If one of my close friends died, I'd move on after a while. Maybe our friendship is poisonous for you. Some distance would be good for us. Maybe it would be best for you if we weren't friends at all, but you don't seem to think that that's a good idea. I know how it is to like someone more than they like you back, but I can't cope with people being too clingy and needy, it makes me uncomfortable. I don't have a best friend at the moment, and I actually don't want one. Maybe we can go back to the friendship we used to have, but therefore you'll have to get better first.

Instead of value compared to US currency, I will represent its value in comparison to income over time. The darker the stone, the more valuable the currency is, with the exception of moonstone.

      "suicide - Looking for a reason to go onI've juggled the idea around in my head for a long time but never have I been so close to actually ending it. It started back when I was in high school. Sophomore year I was diagnosed with depression but for reasons unbeknownst to me I wasn't able to take any sort of medication. The first couple of years the thought occasionally popped into my head but I dismissed it as just part of being an \"angsty teen\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Senior year was different for me, though. It was college admissions time and I was looking to enroll at the honors program at my stage college, so I needed an edge that made me seem better than the standard applicant. That's when my parents revealed that I was diagnosed as autistic (Asperger's syndrome to be more specific). I was actually diagnosed as a kid and they did everything they could to make sure that I could try and live a normal life, and for elementary school I felt like I was just a kid, no mental disorders or anything despite a few odd quirks I had. Once high school rolled around that all changed as I found it increasingly harder to socialize and \"fit in\", finding that some of my \"quirks\" became a lot more amplified and prominent than I remember them being and finding that I had a genuine fear and inability of being social outside of my comfort zone. The more I thought about it the more a lot of my earlier life made sense, and the more I started to hate myself and see myself as some sort of mistake or genetic freak. I feel like I should be counting myself lucky that I was part of the \"fortunate few\" who are diagnosed with autism and actually have some sort of intellectual \"benefit\", but there are still too many drawbacks to this curse to even make me consider myself lucky. With the combination of depression and autism (and with it the increased self-loathing) I felt myself much closer to the edge than ever before, but I still found some happiness in the world and had a few reasons to keep moving on, so I powered through until college.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this point things weren't great for me, but they could have been worse. Due to my \"condition\" I had unintentionally pushed away a lot of my friends before-hand and the few I had were usually preoccupied with their own lives, so when it came to college I was on my own for the most part. I tried my best to make new friends and actually made a couple (although I feel like they all just stayed around me because they knew something was wrong with me and they felt bad). I also had 3 \"motivators\" that kept me going when things got rough: video games, alcohol (something I had recently discovered) and a dog that I had loved since childhood. The year started off fine, classes weren't too hard and I was actually enjoying myself for awhile, where any sort of \"bad thoughts\" seldom drifted through my mind. \n",
      "\n",
      "Mid year though, things took a drastic turn for the worst. When I was visiting home one weekend I woke up to my parents telling me that my dog had to be put down last night and they didn't want to wake me beforehand. I was absolutely devestated. I had never really dealt with death beforehand so to know that my favorite pet was just gone, with no chance to say any goodbyes crushed me. After that things got worse to me. I turned to my other two \"vices\" to try and get my mind off of things (at this point my dog dying was only one of many concerns, including some of my \"friends\" trading me out for the latest model as well as failing my first class) so I started drinking more heavily and playing more games, which in turn hurt school more. At one point my friends cut me off of the sauce, not out of concern but because I \"wasn't worth it\" to supply anymore, so now I was down to games. Things kept getting worse, home life became much more tense, and I felt my friends slowly dropping off one by one. \n",
      "\n",
      "Two things happened this week that finally pushed me past my breaking point. I played one game in particular (Runescape) that I poured most of my time into for the past few years. With a double xp weekend, I was actually happy to get on and have some fun. I got on last night to find that my account was banned because of a supposed \"bot\" (I never used a bot in my life, it was never worth the risk) and that there was no way for my account to be recovered. Everything that I had worked so hard for was just gone in an instant, and I had lost my last escape from reality. The other thing was a realization that had just occurred to me. My high school dating life was practically nonexistent, and my knowledge of my \"condition\" only made things harder in college. Any attempts I made for any sort of relationship were either met with brutal rejections or unenthusiastic \"No\"s. One of the only things I really wanted in life was some sort of relationship, someone else who really cared about me. Valentine's Day week (and all the happy couples making their happiness as obvious as possible) made me feel like I'm going to be forced to live the rest of my life alone and die the same way.\n",
      "\n",
      "I can't take it anymore. I feel like an outcast and a freak who will never know what it's like to feel love or any sort of happiness. I feel like my mind is continuously slipping and my mental state is only getting worse. I can't find enough happy moments in my life to outweigh all the lows. I feel like I have nothing left for me to live for, and the only reason I haven't gone ahead and pulled the trigger is because I know how devastated the few people who care about me would feel. I just need some reason, any sort of reason or motivation to keep living.\n",

When my husband told me he had an affair I turned to one of his friends to try to understand. No I did not have a sexual relationship with this friend but were very close. Understandably I don't trust easily but he knew my history and I thought I could trust him. He needed help with his daughter while he was going through a divorce and I did. She now calls me mom. Well friend moved away and turns out he was just using me. Quit talking to me once he left. His daughter still talks to me,she is 13. Her mom was deemed unfit and her dad is an alcoholic whore who didn't even come home last night but didn't bother to tell her. She stayed up waiting for him and was scared when she woke up and he wasn't there. Here is the pain part. I can't do anything to help her.

For example, if you were in Middle School and in the Freshman year of high school, and lockdown started on March 20, you would be in lockdown for the whole rest of the year until March 20, 2021 then resume Freshman year until summer vacation. Yes, you age one year and you’re grad year is something different and sure it’s a full year on lockdown but it would help so much with preventing COVID-19 and scheduling summer sports and extracurricular activities. The sooner we get back in schools, the more COVID cases there will be for kids and families and possibly more deaths. And schools reopening now? This is not the time we should be required to take online school or wait until next year because we will just have to take another quarantine anyway. I don’t mind waiting longer or until a vaccine is out if that means that I can go to school like normal, I dont want to do any “hybrid learning” options or full online where it’s just filling out brainless paperwork and not learning at all. Kids are still going to take masks off and that kind of thing because they don’t take this thing seriously, and some of the really young kids probably have no idea or can comprehend what’s happening.\n",

      "Unfortunately, whenever I think about what you guys have done for me and how supportive you are, I just end up feeling really, really sad. I'll demonstrate how I feel with this story:  \n",
      "I'm not sure where I heard this, but to this day it still makes me sadder than pretty much anything else---like make me tear up at the thought of it type sadness: The basic gist of the story is that there's a young kid who really likes Minecraft and doesn't have any friends. His dad knows he's kind of a loner just by seeing that he spends most of his time playing Minecraft, but doesn't actually know that he doesn't really have any friends. It's a saturday night, and the dad comes in to his son's room to see that he's just playing Minecraft again, and wanting him to get more out of life and be happy, he gives him some money and tells him to go out for dinner or a movie or something with his friends. The kid---not wanting to disappoint his father/let him know he has no friends/make his dad feel like he's helping him---decides to hide his laptop and gaming stuff in his backpack and he tells his dad he's going out with friends, only to head to a starbucks or something and use the money to buy a coffee....then he just plays minecraft.  \n",
      "I think the reason why this story gets to me so much is because I can remember tons of times where you guys have done something similar and I either:  \n",
      "A) Went out and used the money to buy and smoke weed, thinking that that would be the actual only way to feel better  \n",
      "2) Either never actually did what you told me to for whatever reason or I actually did do it and felt even worse afterwards  \n",
      "3) I've hidden how bad things actually are from you and mom to protect both your feelings/mental state as well as ensure my own ability to continue using   \n",
      "D) The very act of hearing you or mom say \"here, take my card and why don't you hit up Griffin and go to a movie\" or something along those lines as a response to me feeling down makes me incredibly sad to hear. To this day, the scenario where I'm feeling really down and you guys tell me \"why don't you go do X with this friend/here, this idea/thought/activity will make you feel better\" regardless of if money is involved is just a really, really sad thing for me. It's hard for me to actually understand and articulate why this is.   \n",
      "I know I casually brought up over break that I've always wanted to just up and leave the country for a while and not tell anyone, and to be honest I've never actually wanted to do that as much as I do now. It seems life my whole has been a story of escape and a battle vs me and reality and that's pretty much the reasoning behind this desire. I'm at a place in my life where I can either be sober and thus really depressed/almost suicidal due to wanting to escape the pain....for a whole year....and even then things might not look a whole lot better, or I can keep drinking/smoking till I inevitably encounter health problems very early on and/or kill myself because I'm just tired of it all.   \n",
      "As we've discussed before, I can't imagine a life in which I'm both happy and sober, but it's not really about that....sometimes there just seems to be too much pain and misery in the world to manage. Not even my own necessarily, but I often wonder if life is just sort of a cruel joke that people are able only to tolerate at best, and most people never even make it to that level. Sometimes I think there's too much pain in this world to justify my continuing to live, like if it's this shitty, not even for me but for a hell of a lot of people, and there might not even be an objective purpose or order to any of the suffering if there is no god, then why even deal with any of it?   \n",
      "I would say I'm in a pretty bad place mentally right now but I just emailed the counseling office I used to go to and asked when the therapist I'm trying to see is free. I want to get through this but it's not going well. I missed a class today but overall I'm doing pretty good in school, but I just feel really trapped and like no matter what I do I'm just kind of screwed. I get that it's on me for making the poor decisions that led me to this point, but the thing is I constantly question whether or not it's even worth it to put in the effort to be happy/improve my life/better myself if it might not even work and it's gonna be really hard.   \n",

      "non-suicide - My Uncle is a developer of Cyberpunk 2077, and sent out a limited-time package to me, but I'm not allowed to play the game. TL:DR at bottom. \n",
      "\n",
      "For some context, I'd be considered one of the many younger ones on this subreddit. I'm 13, going on 14. My Uncle has been an employee for CD Projekt Red for quite some time, too. Once the game was announced, he'd told me as much as he was allowed to at the time, and I'd always want to know more. The hype around the game was/is insane, and I was only more exited about it, because my Uncle had been working on it. \n",
      "\n",
      "At the games launch, I knew I wouldn't get it right off the bat. I was okay with that, though. I've never been one too eager to always get X thing first. I never really thought about it, but always figured that I'd be able to play it soon. \n",
      "\n",
      "Eventually, I got a a sweater/fall jacket thing that resembles that of the main character of the game. Although not a 100% accurate hoodie, it was (and is!) really damn cool. It even has some of the Easter eggs from the game on it, too. If my memory serves me, there was only so many made, and of course it was limited edition. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then came today. Each developer is sent one of the \"care-packages\" for making their game. (This time the public can buy it, and I don't think it's limited edition.) Being the great guy my Uncle is, instead of keeping it for himself, he gave it to me, and my siblings. The package pretty damn cool. There's all sorts of stuff in there, like a map of the in game city, a figure, and other things I won't waste your time with. Eventually we face-time him, talking about how cool it is. But then comes up the topic about my age, and the maturity of the game.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a nutshell, I can't play the game. Even though I've seen just about everything there is to the world (ifyaknowwhatimean,) they don't think I should be playing Cyberpunk. I'm rather unsure about how to feel about this. On one hand, they are totally right. In theory, I am way too young to be playing. But then again, I play COD, R6S, Rust, ect. With that logic, I'm allowed to essentially commit war crimes in game, but I can't see a naked body, which is as old as 5 fingers on our hand. Like, I know what it took make me, and every other human being, so I don't really see what's wrong with the occasional sight  every here and there, especially if the game is fiction. Don't get me wrong, I'm not mad at my family for their decision, but it still kinda sucks.\n",
      "\n",
      "TL:DR I got really hyped for Cybrepunk2077, got sent a package with game related stuff, but currently am not allowed to play the game, because I'm too young. One part of me thinks it's nice to see them looking out for me, but another part of me wants to play the game.\n",

      "suicide - Feeling disconnected and a failureWent through a messy breakup three years ago which did a huge number on my confidence. I dealt with that by working long hours everyday and neglecting my health. I became mildly successful at my job. After two years of using my job as a distraction I realised it doesn't fulfil me. Figured I'd try and connect with people in hopes of feeling a little bit less lonely. I had plans with my colleagues to go to a bar tonight but they blew me off. I also made an attempt of putting myself out there. I met someone and we planned our first date tomorrow. Two days ago she texted me saying she wasn't sure if she'd finish the assignments for her thesis so she cancelled. I just found out she spend the entire day sightseeing in Brussels. I feel like shit. I feel treated like shit.\n",

I want it to get better but it keeps getting worse in other ways and I can't blanace living life properly. I don't *WANT* to feel this way, or feel like death is the option and to boot if I *am* pregnant I couldn't do that to a life inside me... But I feel like I've just failed everyone... I'm just worried. I want to give my boyfriend a break from my bullshit. It's been five years, and he's so patient but seeing him struggle is hurting me, and I need to get better. This part of me wants to be a cam girl u til I get into a job support program in my city (it's in the works, just waiting for support to open up, and I would tell him, not doing so is wrong) to pay some bills but I'm not sure that's a good idea.

      "non-suicide - i dont know where my life is goingim currently in high school, and my family isn’t fairly well off. my parents work long hours and i have to look after my two littler sisters everyday. my dad, although he drinks and smokes weed often, is a very stoic man. i look up to him in a way. however he nags to me about how i should take up a sport and do something with my life. he constantly complains about this and i understand why. i could possibly get a scholarship so my family would have to pay less for college, but i really feel nothing towards sports. i dont really care for sports and ive never enjoyed participating in them. i dont want to let him down, so i tried doing soccer. i felt very out of place there and i was made fun of alot for constantly having cramps during conditioning. i was sick of it so i quit. when i told my dad he brushed it off, but i knew he was disappointed in me. at the time i was really struggling alot with myself and problems i had with the people around me, and on top i had some pretty hard ap classes. all around i was stressed and i had nobody to turn to for help. its been a couple months after this whole debacle, and i cant say ive gotten any better. ive been able to keep up with grades, but im beginning to feel empty. i feel talentless and idk just capable of nothing. all my hobbies are all art related, and i dont think pursuing a career in editing would make my dad proud. my relationships feel shallow as well, like i feel like i cant tell anybody this or ill just be made fun of or looked down upon. idk. i just want to stop trying so hard. tbh ive considered a life of 9 to 5 where i can play video games in my spare time. i feel like i would have less worries doing that. but i dont want to disappoint my family as the oldest. idk i just really dont know whats in store for me next and im scared.\n",

      "non-suicide - After a shitty Christmas, I sent 3 texts.Today all started with my dad not being home. I don't get to visit him often, as he lives far away from me and I can't travel (I'm 15). My brother was home, the same brother who raped me as a child. While that's not a problem anymore, I still fear him. We went to my grandmothers house, and no one knew I was on the island. I thought they did. All my aunts and uncles looked over me. My cousins took me to a room where I watched them play a game. One of my cousins, we'll call him Kevin, has been obsessed with me for years. He's my age now, and kept looking at me in a way that made me uncomfortable. Eventually, my mom called and told me and my brother to go pick her up. Dad still wasn't home, so I told my brother, and he asked me to go with him. We got to the airport slightly late, because the dog got out and we had to chase him down. When we went to pick her up, she yelled at us and told us that we're not worthy of being loved. My brother drove her 2 streets away from my dad's house and told her how to get to my uncle's house. She told me to get out the car. My brother was already halfway to the house. He has the beeper for the gate, and I don't. Mom drove off. I called to my brother, but can't run to him. There's probably glass on the road and I was wearing heels. He gets home before I do, I get to the closed gate. Dad still isn't home. It's 8:00pm by now. I ask my brother to let me in, he says no, go with mom. I tell him mom left, but I'll go to grandmas's house. My cousin was still there. It was either my brother let me in or I face whatever he's going to do to me. My brother finally lets me in.

When no one was looking, I snuck his limp body into the bathroom where I put his fursuit on him and fondled his fur-balls!

      "suicide - Could really use some advice for my friendMy friend (M20) has been saying since I met him that he is going to kill himself someday. Usually he says this confidently but lightheartedly, usually with a chuckle or grin. It’s hard to take him seriously in person, almost like he’s presenting it in a relatable way. He has also been posting long paragraphs of how he can’t wait for death and how he’s only ever been comfortable on a noose. For almost as long as he’s been part of our friend group we have wanted to help him in any way we can, but he is incredibly resistant to change. A lot of our friends and acquaintances have put their money, reputations, and homes out on a limb for him, but he always seems to mess it up by being wildly insensitive and detached, often throwing blame around in a very defensive and sometimes offensive way. He is a master of words, and can throw you off and distract you until you give up. He’s incredibly stubborn and can improvise a defense using half-lies on the spot. If he gets caught in a lie or if he’s objectively wrong, he rarely ever admits it and has been hurting us all. We all feel like there are a lot of secrets he’ll never tell us or anyone who doesn’t already know. We found out his old friend groups that he says are some of his favorite people actually resent him for this behavior and more. None of us want that to happen this time.\n",

      "Any confrontation involving this has been met with jokes and defense. We’ve tried talking but he’s too good at that. We simply can’t convince him of anything that didn’t come out of his own head. His past is tragic, he has a god complex that fuels most of his unruly decisions, he’s been smoking weed every day for probably longer than we have known him. We encourage him to grow but he insists he’d almost rather go back to living on the streets than stay in the home he’s in now. He argues that it’s his right to make every decision for himself, including killing himself, and that we should all be ok with it. One of his finsta posts is even him hanging from a noose in his bathroom. We’re all afraid to take action because he is avoidant impulsive and we all assume he would just skip town and stop talking to us if we tried to get him some real help (without his consent because he would never consent).\n",

VentI haven't tried suicide in about 1.5 weeks, same for cutting. i finally broke, im sick of these feelings i have, i fuck up to much, i even resorted to drugs to fill in this emptyness, every time im happy i still feel depression hitting me, theres always somthing i do to make me depressed, my hands are really shakey now. I hitted a vein last night cutting but why didn't i die? It was deepish. So many times i tried to die but fucking failed. Honestly only reason i dont want to end my life is because of my family. I dont want to leave them. hell anxiety depression and constant suicidal thoughts are reason im failing school with an avrage of 27% i cant even write or sleep at night. Fuck, i refuse to talk to a guidance councillor, and everyone who i pm doesn't reply back, because its disturbing.One thing that depresses me out is, yesterday i was hanging with my friend laughing our asses of about stuff and i saw a kid and his mom walking in to a&amp;w to eat. The kid was so happy and excited i wish i was the kid, happy and living life, i wish i had a dad not the abusive asshole my mom devorced , but a good one,i wish i was like 8 and my mom was holding my hand and dad was holding the other as we walked to a resturant. Everytime i think about this it makes me cry, i guess i gotta let it go as it will never happen.  Im actually hitted inanity, i once in awhile hear a voice in my head of a girl saying ''take the razor again'' and or  ''it will be a few seconds to go'' im crazy. I even have dreams at night ending up with me dying by a gun or a blade. My goal in life is to live in japan tokyo by age 25. 16 and cant even make it though a day without trying to kill myself.\n",

Everyone is tired of me, and worn out of trying to help and its all my fault. I've ruined my families lives just be being a selfish prick. I've talked to many therapists, and while my current one is great, I never feel like I'm making any progress, mostly because I dont care enough to try any of the things he tells me. I've left behind so many people and screwed myself over by alienating any people I used to get along with. Now I sit along at home everyday, too afraid to speak my mind, and too cowardly to ask for help. I feel like no one around me believes that I'm this badly off, or if they've just given up trying. Now Reddit is the only place I can turn. I dont know what the fuck to do and even if I did I would be too cowardly and scared to do anything about it. I'm such a selfish piece of shit \n",

      "\n",
      "Prior to the trip and all of my life I have been extremely observant and analytical since I’ve had real consciousness. Before it was only thoughts that past by me, thoughts that held no weight with me. I could allow them to go and my only real problems were the typical depression, anxiety, suicidal thoughts and miscellaneous other symptoms of a few things. That started around 12 for me so I was very used to existing like that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Things started getting worse before my trip, the thoughts gained weight and some didn’t leave. I heavily started questioning my existence. One of which was the simulation philosophy. So much so that I forced myself to stay awake for days to see if I could “compromise the simulations integrity.” What actually happened was I passed out in class from exhaustion and woke up to my dad telling me to get up and come to the car. Although now the philosophy doesn’t bind me quite so much anymore, it shows you the state I was in before tripping. If you don’t know, psychedelics and the experience you have are heavily correlated with your mindset. This was not a good mindset clearly, but I neglected that for whatever reason. \n",

Almost like a void, like I was being teleported to a place with all of the secrets of the universe and this place was forcing all of them into me all at once. Completely broken, I was quite literally in the lap of one of my close friends gargling incoherently and crying. Nothing made sense anymore, even more so than before. The night ended after I made myself vomit, then couldn’t stop vomiting. All I wanted was to fall asleep and make it all stop. I didn’t sleep for a full day after that. I couldn’t.

She somehow convinced me to go get food with her. The entire way their my brain was going fucking haywire. Tearing everything apart. I believe at that time my object permanence truly started fleeting because I for the life of me could not comprehend any existence beyond the bounds of my vision. To clarify, any room I sat in was the only room in existence. Noises outside the bounds of its walls were only attempts by my mind to create depth to the reality I reside in. We get to the restaurant and I am having a full blown internalized panic attack (how all of my panic attacks happen.) She got her food and we sat down. She’s talking, I know she is because I see her mouth out of my peripheral vision. I am not looking at her. I’m looking at everything else. The people walking around, the chairs, walls, floors, the curtains, doorways, my hands especially them. All the while my internal monologue is screaming things to convince me I don’t exist. I couldn’t handle it. I got up and just left. I just walked out. No warning. She didn’t even question it, part of me knows she expected that outcome. That was no where near my rock bottom but I’ll just allow that to give you a sense of my progressively worsening state.\n",

What else can I do. I’ve had a psychiatrist for the past 8 months and I’ve been working so hard to bring myself back up. I lost all of my ability to socialize after that day and now I am so aware of the things I say it’s mind numbing. That in and of itself causes me so much anxiety because I constantly feel the need to hold up conversation with people I fucking hate because they all feel so empty. Everything is empty.\n",

I would rather consume myself by my own choice than wait for the day it consumes me. I self harmed today I cut all over my arms and I wish I hadn’t stopped because fuck it felt so good.

For context, Spartacus was a mercenary who fought with the Romans before fighting them. They were very vengeful.

      "suicide - I don’t see the point in living anymore. There’s no hope for me at all.The reason I feel this way is because I’m absolutely sick and tired of waking up everyday to the same crap knowing it’s never going to get better. Some back story:\n",
      "\n",
      "My moms boyfriend basically ruined both my mom and I’s lives. He’s stolen so much from us and has costed us a good chunk of money just to try to get him out of our lives but it didn’t work. So for an entire year we tried to run away from him and start a new life but it just didn’t work and now we’re left with less money and stuff than we did before. He’s still in our lives and even though my mom kept saying he’s gone for good he’s still here. I’m sick and tired of having him around and my mom constantly lying to me saying everything’s over but it’s not. I wasted the prime of my teenage years dealing with this constant running and moving that I’ve missed out on everything other kids my age are doing. Because I’m constantly moving I ended up becoming homeschooled and as a result I have no friends anywhere. I’m still a minor and can’t even get a drivers license let alone a car so my only choice is to stay home. We have no free money to spend so we can’t go anywhere either. My mom is retired so we only live off of her check. I can’t even get a job. I’m stuck 24/7 at the house wasting away the “best years of my life” and I doubt that’s ever gonna change.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, I’ve been dealing with suicidal thoughts since I was 7 years old. The only thing that stopped me was knowing how heartbroken my mom would be because we only have each other and I could never leave her. Well now she’s also suicidal and is sure she’ll die in the next two years. She also mentioned that if I die then she wouldn’t be able to handle it and possibly kill herself too. My mom was the only thing keeping me from committing suicide and now if she dies I don’t have a thing left to live for. I have no other family at all so if she dies I’ll just be thrown into foster care. I’m so alone in this world my mom is the only person I live for. And now she hates life and would rather die. I have literally nothing to live for. We can’t even afford therapy. We just barely got insurance but we still can’t go. I’ve been in a mental hospital before but that didn’t help at all. If I ever went to a hospital again I’d just be a burden on my mom. I’m so sick and tired of waking up everyday knowing I’m just gonna go asleep crying. I don’t see a point anymore. I’m so freaking fed up. I don’t even know why I’m writing this. I just want this all to end. It’s not like it’s ever gonna change. I’m seriously thinking about just ending my life. I should’ve just killed myself when I was 7 and wanted to chug pills and die.\n",

      "suicide - I'm a mess.This is going to be a self-indulgent and self-piteous post and it makes me feel more shitty. I just am so sick of feeling this way. I still can find flashes of happiness but it's always fleeting and temporary, my emotions are so unstable. I think I have a deep seated fear of abandonment, I have no idea why. Usually people have been abandoned in the past or have experiences trauma but I haven't. I've had a lovely upbringing so I feel guilty for feeling this way. I just feel so loveless and hopeless. So many changes have taken place in my life, mainly due to COVID-19. I've been talking to a guy for a bit now and yesterday he called me up and said he's not ready for a relationship. That's cool and I understand his needs because he's been through past trauma etc. But it doesn't erase the hurt, and I'll admit I feel a bit angry and I feel guilty about this anger because I have no right to be angry. I'm tired of my moods feeling like a roller-coaster, up and down all the time. I know my family love me and I love them too but I just feel so empty and hopeless and I just want to die sometimes. Some days are better than others and these suicidal feelings go away but they always come back. Sorry for ranting, and I understand this is full of self-pity and I hate it. But I had to get it off my chest. Hope everyone is okay. \n",

I don't ever want to choose to end my life at any specific moment, but I hope to finish life before very old age. I'm 27 and posted in bipolar subreddit to talk, I feel better than I have my whole life. I'm doing well in terms of following my career goal, but a slew of mental disorders is exhausting to manage and I worry it will get worsw, because I exhibit and realize I have numerous psychologically diagnosed conditions by my psychiatrist. The latest incident is last year where I wake up every morning feeling tense and needing to hurl, clonzapam has helped curb incidents when I have on me. Life has been an uphill battle to finds myself and control my disorders and I worry about my future. I feel irresponsible to start a family with my inability to be consistent in my emotions and a great of passing a mental disorder to a child. It hurts that o recently had dreams where I have kids these past months, because I feel I am not balanced or stable enough to give a child everything they deserve(what I feel I needed as a kid growing up). My father has my mental disorders and my  life was very unstable growing up fast of his mood swings. I grew up anxious and without any semblance of confidence, which took a huge toll on me; for the rest of my life even. I've faced a lot of my fears and am better off but I really hope I don't become old and worse mentally than I am now. It feels inevitable and I hope to pass away before that takes hold. I abuse drugs, alcohol, cigarettes, and engage in risky behavior; something expected of someone with bipolar and other disorders. I just want to vent and say I hope to ruib my body and choose pass away(I don't consider our suicide but it feels similar). I don't know how to make paragraphs so sorry for the wall of text. Maybe I'll pass out soon\n",

      "suicide - I just want to dieEverything is just so hard all the time and Im tired of people just telling me it will get better because how am I supposed to believe that? When I was 8 I would cry myself to sleep cause I wanted to die and now Im 20 and nothing has changed. I had an entire plan 2 months ago but on that decided to move across the country back to where I lived before so I could get better and it only keeps getting worse. Im more suicidal now and my depression just keeps getting worse. Im tired of all the shit in my head, ive been diagnosed with too much shit.  Depression ,Social Anxiety, Borderline Personality DIsorder, ARFID and ANorexia and Im tired of it all. There is no better. Honestly ive had most of these problems since i was so young, there is no getting better, its just a life of constant hell. I want to go buy a gun and just end it all, and hell I live in the south its not that hard to just get a gun. I only havent since ive been back because im back with my parents and I dont want them to find me. But at the same time I keep thinking yeah ill destroy them but ill be dead and a dead person cant care or see the aftermath. It just hurts so bad all the time and no matter how much therapy or psychiatry or pills or weed nothing helps. And ive been sober for like 20 days and it sucks so much ass, just so I can get a job. Ill never be able to actually do hat I want in life cause anxiety and depression. Its a field where there are no stable jobs and I have to constntly be looking and I just cant do that. Yay for the life oF an artist. And fuck its not even what I actually want to do, but ill never be able to do this or that. Ill always be miserable and stuck working retail or some shit with a schdule just cause I cant do things without a schedule. And then ill never fucking be loved and im pathetic and thats all I want but im fucking unloveable and ill never have a stable relationship. I just think about suicide most of my day every single day, for so many years now. I havent even cut myself in maybe 2 months now cause I dont want to, I just want to kill myself. Cutting wouldnt be enough. I can barely get out of bed ever, I only shower maybe once a month and brush my teeth even less, my room is a mess, everything is a mess. thanks depression. Im fucking disgusting, im pathetic, im helpless, im hopeless, im useless, i absolutely hate myself. I cant do this much longer, I have to get out soon. Ive tried so hard for so long and I just cant anymore. I cry so much. Im so horrible to everyone I know eventually because of my mood swings and Ihate it I hate who I am. It sucks but i truly am nothing more than my mental illnesses. Im sorry this is kinda all over the place im kinda just throwing all my thoughts down as they come, adn there are alot, I know theres more I want to type but I didnt imagine even typing this much would be so exhausting so quick. Guess Ill edit if I think of the rest of my bullshit. I dont even know exactly why IM posting this, theres no changing anyting, itll happen soon enough. I guess just thank you for listening.\n",

To their slight credit they don’t do it to people they don’t know but apparently it’s not an uncommon thing at my school and a few schools in my area and some people do it to random people but in every situation the victim is male and it’s not fucking funny.

Right now Im 30(M) and life is mostly me just getting by. Today I couldnt get that out of my head. My life was rough growing up, and I keep reminding myself that I should be proud to have gotten this far. But because of how life was I didnt do the things people my age should have done. Today I thought \"maybe im not completely out of luck. Sure Im broke with no career, and im already middle aged, but i feel like im 18. i feel young and like i should be able to have those experiences still\" and I felt a little better. Then I made a really big mistake. You see I never was one for taking pictures of myself but there were a few times over the years that I snapped a selfie. I went to the mirror this afternoon, as if I expected to find something I liked. But damn, Im unmistakably old. Dark circles under my eyes from restless nights. Sunken cheeks. Scarred cheeks from latent acne. Completely bald. Pale skin. I thought, \"hey maybe its not that bad, maybe its just the depression messing with my eyes\". Thats when I made my mistake. I opened one of those old selfies and was taken aback. Fuck. I was actually cute. Head full of curly black hair, full smooth cheeks, a cute smirk, tan skin. I looked young and full of vitality. And I hated myself. I thought I was hideous. I was terrified of people, could barely say a word to anyone. But my god I was actually pretty cute and I never actually realized it until now. But it doesnt matter because all of that is gone. Its a cruel joke to play on someone. I could have found someone who loved me if I had just had the self esteem to go out. I know ther eis no way I could, not after what I had gone through in my early life, but still. Now here I am, my biggest mental scars patched, but it doesnt matter. If I was still that cute shy boy maybe I someone would ignore the fact that Im 30 with no money. maybe they would ignore the inexperience and teach me how to have a relationship. But not now, not like this. No one would ever put that much work into something that looks like its been rotting in a grave. I think about that a lot too. I havent had a week go by in my life where I didnt feel horrid at some point. I havent been given a hug in 12 years. I just keep telling myself \"just keep going, just dont give up, it will get better if you keep trying\" but... it hasnt. I dont know what Im doing this for. I hate this, it hurts so bad. It hurt when I was a kid, it hurt when I turned 18 and moved away from my horrible home. It hurts now. Its not getting better, Im not making the progress I need to to catch up. Im just getting older. Ive overcome so many things, so much damage, but no one can see that. They werent there, they didnt know what I was before so all they see is this broke 30 year old ugly guy with no car or a career or house of his own. ten years ago I wouldnt have been able to say hello to a stranger. Now I can, and people can tolerate if not like me. But no one wants me, not really. Everyone has their friends by now. Everyone has their lovers and families. No one has room for someone like me. Its too much work, too inconvenient. And the road ahead is far too long. I dont think I could learn how to have a lover, or integrate into a friend group. I just... I just think Im torturing myself by doing this. I think deep down I knew years ago that there was no way I could really fix myself. And I tried, I really really did. I pushed myself to learn how to communicate with others, I worked, I tried therapy and drugs and meditation. But deep down there has always been something broken in me. And even though I didnt give up, I didnt know what to do either. But I think now, looking in the mirror, that im that old chevy that someone left out in a field long ago. no matter how much rust you scrape off it wont ever be enough. Just go and buy one that runs. No point in breaking your back dealing with that mess. I cant really offer anything to anyone. Even I dont think Im worth salvaging anymore. I had hoped, for some reason, that things really would turn out ok. I read the upbeat quips and the promises that its all ok in the end but really... I dont think so. It was so hard to get here. And Im still broken. When I think of going through another 30 years of this... god I feel like im going to vomit. This is the real world. Its a world where cold and cruel things happen. A world where parent hurt their children, where strangers judge and condemn other strangers they just met, a world where peopel die cold and alone in the streets. This isnt a fairy tale. No prince charming shows up to slay the dragon. No enchanted dresser pulls you into a land of magic. If I havent fixed myself by now I never will. And today I realized I lost the only thing that I might have been able to bargain with, and I didnt even know I had it. I cant believe how cute I used to be. I should have pushed myself even harder and found someone who would take me in their arms and teach me what its like to be loved. But maybe Im wrong about that too. Maybe love is just another fairy tale. Maybe all the people i see with lovely lives, who smile and laugh and embrace, maybe they dont feel anything. maybe its no better than being alone. maybe I fooled myself into going forward because I wanted to believe there was a place that was different from the dark place where I started. But if thats true, then I dont want to do it for another 30 years. It hurt so much just to get here. Maybe Im just weak, and stronger people would have learned to cope faster. from a scientific standpoint, all these emotions are really just a form of selection right? just chemicals in the void. I dont really exist anyway. if i didnt, then it would be just like it was before i was born. I cant remember what it was like before I was born. I like that. Not remembering. no more nightmares. no more panic attacks. no more self hatred. no more long empty road, surrounded by people yet still, somehow, utterly alone. nothing i do means anything anyway. im just atoms in the void. I dont even really exist, I just think I do. \n",

      "   I am 21/m, and here's some backstory: grew up well-off, but with a case of undiagnosed depression and one of those families that never owned up to just how dysfunctional it really was. It was my senior year of high school when all the previously ignored shit finally hit the the proverbial fan, though. My father lost his job, and my parents decided to split. My family, now just my mother, me, and two sisters, went from living a living a comfortable lifestyle to just making ends meet. We moved to a tiny house, and my mom was forced to find a job to keep us afloat. \n",
      "   All throughout this process my depression and anxiety issues start coming to a head. I would go to school and just have panic attacks and either just walk around the place aimlessly in a weird haze, or skip school altogether to drink or do drugs. Eventually I dropped out. \n",
      "   Ever since then, things just got worse and worse. I started getting into more serious drugs until I started using strong painkillers and heroin. My mother kicked me out, and I was forced to move in with my father who sort of lived with his friend. My first night there, he explains the reason for the divorce was that he explained to my mother that he was, in fact, a gay man, and he couldn't go on living a lie, I guess. While it made sense, and I WAS extremely sympathetic to his coming out, I couldn't help but feel alienated and weirded out. Also, I never really had a great relationship with him in the first place. He was never the typical dad and also had his bouts with alcoholism here and there, and I honestly didn't really like him for that, even in spite of viewing everything now through the lens of his coming out. \n",
      "   At this point I realized how depressed I was, feeling really suicidal daily, but I was able to curtail the self abusive thoughts through drugs and alcohol. I just sort of did not give a fuck about anything anymore I guess. I wasn't in school, and couldn't hold down a job, and this developed into tension between me, my father, and his \"friend.\" Eventually, we almost got into physical altercation, so I peaced the fuck out of there and went from house to house, living with my cousin, and other relatives, and eventually some girl I was sleeping with at the time. \n",
      "   One day my ex girlfriend got really concerned because of my depression and drug use and coerced me to check myself into the psych ward at a hospital. I did. I spend around a week there, and they discharge me with an antidepressant perscription. I continue to live with said girl, whose family actually turns out to be really cool and supportive, and things really start to improve for me mental-health wise as I stay on the Zoloft. \n",
      "   I eventually land a job at a pizzeria so my mother decides it's cool if I come back home, providing I pay rent. I'm psyched, and things are pretty cool for a while. I quit hard drugs and stop hanging out with wasteoids. But, my medication runs out after a month, and I don't have health insurance cause we're poor now. Anxiety comes back tenfold, and I just cant take working at the stressful pizzeria anymore, so I stop showing up. I try to explain to my mother what's up with my depression and anxiety, but she just doesnt get it, and thinks I'm a wimp.

I'm short , hairy,  have really bad acne , puffy face , feminine lips, weak chin, big nose and dark features while living in Eastern Europe . Right now im using acuttane, fin, rogaine , seeing dermotologist for 2 years, but its useless. I'm tired, i look so unhealthy , like homeless . I don't feel comfortable in this body, i can't imagine myself in future looking like this. I feel like men, who is trapped in this fucking small, ugly body. Being like this ruined my life, i can' t live in dorm, because of all medications, so i don't have close friends, i can't leave my house for more than one day.Im so jealous when i see attractive guy or girl,they don't need to listen disgusting words, they don't know what it feels to be rejected by everyone, i would be happy if i could be atleast normal.  Its so fucking unfair that things like genes determine your life, i really hate my parents, i wish i was never born, i hate when they ask why i don't have girlfriend or why my grades are getting worse. I'm not weak, i tried all the best i can, i tried be confident, charismatic , funny and etc and nothing worked. So why i have to suffer every day? I was strong till now, but i can't take it anymore. I wish reincarnation is real, so that means i have small chance to be more lucky. My parents have a gun, im scared , but i really want to do that.

I’m a full on coward though. I’ve tried to stop eating but i have no self control. I’ve wanted to purge yet i don’t have the guts to make myself throw up. At this point just looking at myself in the mirror will make me want to cry and i don’t know why. Today i overslept and i started breaking down and crying about it. I have track tryouts tomorrow but the past two months i’ve spent half to all of the day in bed almost every single day. I feel weak and heavy. I’m not even tired anymore but if i get in bed i can’t get out, like when you wake up in the morning with barely any sleep. I’ve stopped going on runs, doing digital art, now i stopped doing traditional art. I have poor social skills and poorer social judgement. I lost two close friends because they wanted me to share a problem. I shared but they won’t talk to me anymore. I have a friend though but she hates the way i dress, i love a leather jacket i have but if i wore it to school she’d make fun of it. I love my friend and none of how i feel is her fault. i do miss how i would be happy to show off my style, which i thought was nice, now i don’t even feel the need to get dressed in the morning now that i know it’s ugly . My brother always talks about how mentally healthy i am and said “she only hates herself sometimes” but every day i think of killing myself. If i even started to talk about how i feel the way he does he’d probably start comparing it to how he feels and his problems. Making it seem okay. Im failing school. I’m tired of spending everyday in bed with a hollow feeling that’s painful at the same time. Tired of feeling so worthless and disgusting and ugly. Yet i don’t have the guts to kill myself. I’m so selfish i literally have everything yet i wanna die. I have a good family and a good friend. I have the best pet in the world. She’s the reason i’m living at this point. I love my cat and if she died i wouldn’t know what to do, i sobbed because she wasn’t in my room one day. I love her so much, yet she hates me too. I’m so stupid for posting this here or at all but I wanna let it all out even if i know i’m going to regret this. I just want it to stop.\n",

They have a child. A bastard is born (Me). Father does run. I grow up facing abuse from my mother. Then I am 11 she takes me to turkey for religious reasons against my will. I was happy in Germany kinda. Then it really starts. I get bad treatment from my peers because I have no dad and because I am interracial. Fairly innocent. Then I get a bit older. My peers and teachers realize that I am a bastard (Surnames suck). I get beat up get spit on and generally get treated like dirt. Beatings got so bad that I even get a few broken teeth. Once I got close with a girl. Her older brother did almost set me on fire but then he did settle for putting out a cigarette on me. This way I got some nice reminders of what I am. Then money starts to run out and I had to drop out of school. I've always been treated like shit in school anyways. I adopt every way of earning money online legal and illegal. I see no point in leaving the house. My mother abuses me still at home. I pay the rent at this point I kick her out. I try to get to a western country where I won't be judged for things that aren't in my control and to continue education. Save up a bit of money. Guess what none of them takes a high school dropout with no legitimate income.(Yes I asked lawyers.) Fast forward a lot of self-harm and self-loathing. I can't do literally anything. I have to live like this day in day out same food same things till I die. Well and now mandatory military service is coming up. The moment the government of the country that treated me this way gives me a gun I know what I am gonna do. I pay the janitor of the apartment a bit he goes shopping. Entering Europe as a refugee is hard. Most of the refugees get send back anyway. I need to open a company that has a worth of at least 200k to get into a western place. I can't marry my way out of this either. The 4 years took a toll on me and nobody would like to marry me. I think I have considered all options.

I am even scared to have children of my own and what my stepson will feel. We had a great team all together and I feel like she just quit on us. Now my bf and I are alone and it feels so scary without her, my bf use to say he was only a part time dad and that thanks to her he was never stressed about parenting because she was always there to solve help or even solve all the hard parts about parenting. She was my role model when it came to being a mother and just a women all around. I know its weird and that not many people have the luck that I had to have my bf's babymomma not be some crazy ex gf, but instead become a friend. I hate myself for not reaching out to her and falling for her front of being okay when she really was not. I hate that I thought I had time.

      "suicide - I think I'm near the endI am at the end of my teenage years (19F) and I have never been in a relationship. Not one person male or female has ever shown interest in me or cared about me more than just a friend. I am not worthy of anyones time or interest. I am not enough. I have been severely depressed for 5 years. I've also been on medication and been to therapy for years. I have managed to put on a front for my family that I am okay and doing better. I cannot waste any more or their time and resources trying to get better because it's a lost cause, I'll never be better. I decided a long time ago that my life would end in suicide probably when I was around 30 or before then if something else worsened and I was still alone. I knew when I was 15 i was going to end up alone. I am not interesting enough, or special enough, or skinny enough, or pretty enough, to be worth someone's time. And sure enough, 5 years later I'm still alone. The pain is so bad I don't know how much longer I can take it. Everyone says to just be patient and that people find love at all different times throughout life. But I've been in this deep pain and hurt for so long already I can't keep waiting around hoping it'll get better.\n",

Maybe, just maybe tonight, I'll take too many pills and drink too much by \"accident\". I already failed five suicide attempts so I'm incompetent in that regard too. I wish I felt worthy enough to exist. Capable enough to live instead of just rotting and getting by. This is the consequence for being such a pathetic peice of shit.\n",

      "suicide - I want to dieI've always felt like there was something wrong with me. When I was a kid my dad used to beat up me and my mom and when he finally left both he and my mother blamed me for everything. I always grew up with the thought that if I didn't exist my parents would still be happy together you know? That if they had any other child but me it would have been different. I know that that is really stupid to think about but I find myself unable to think differently no matter how hard I try. When I was 14 I was diagnosed with bipolar type 1 and depression after I tried to commit suicide after losing my first love.  I was in and out of mental hospitals and rehab from 14-18 but through it all I always figured life was eventually going to get better and things did get a little better. I was still behind when it came to school but I met the girl of my dreams and it was great until my self destructive habits came back. I started doing drugs again and I treated her like shit. I hurt her terribly and we aren't even really friends now. My life came crashing down almost immediately after. I got kicked out of my house for a time and dropped out of school completely until recently when I decided to re enroll. I decided to go somewhere out of town because i figured with a fresh start I could make things different and I currently live alone I am 21 and I've developed a hardcore pornography addiction that I just can't seem to break and have more recently ventured into dangerous territory with rape and pedophilia which I know is extremely wrong. I don't know why I am suddenly into these things and it makes me feel so much like i'm a piece of trash. I have really poor social skills and with my recent interests I have stopped going out all together for things not work/school related. I am at the point where I cannot look at a woman or a child without feeling shame in myself and I have chosen to lock myself away for the most part to avoid it as I have no idea what to do about it. I used to love to play online video games but i'm actually so afraid of speaking to people that I find myself unable to play anything at all recently. I am currently at a point in my life where I feel like I must be one of the worst humans alive. Due to my poor social skills and since I am so far from the rest of my family I really feel alone all the time. I really don't see how I can fix myself especially with my recent interests I feel like people like myself don't deserve to live. I don't know what to do anymore and I have lost almost all hope. \n",

Because I wrote down my work wrong with all the right answers.

One of the guy's asked me out, even though he knew I was straight. Part of me felt a little better thinking that at least he liked me but I cried that night knowing I lost my chance ever having a girlfriend when I moved from that fucking state. I feel souless.

Everything is a mess. My apartment is a mess. My bills are overdue because I forget to pay them. I have no food at home because I forget to buy it. I can’t keep up. Showering, getting dressed, everything just takes so long because of rituals. Everything is a chore. Everything is overdue. I just can’t keep up. It sounds so ridiculous, but I even considered looking up if a life coach or maybe Occupational Therapy would be an option for me. I’ve tried CBT and antidepressants for the OCD, but nothing worked. My insurance isn’t great, so I can’t afford to keep trying different things and I’m limited to the little that’s available in my network. But I’ve gotten to the point that all I do is go to work and sleep. I don’t have enough hours in the day to do everything I need to do, and that just completely depletes me of energy to do anything. I’ve stopped talking to most people. My communication with the people who I still talk to is limited. Everything around me is overdue and dirty and messy. I just can’t do it anymore.

      "suicide - Can't find a reason to stay in this miseryWhat do you do when you have no one to talk to and even when you try to talk to god it feels like he doesn't listen.  I feel like I have been battling this depression/dysthymia for over thirty years now with no relief.  I have no real friends as when it changed from just mild dysthymia to full blown depression I can no longer help them with their problems/be the clown so they disappear.  And I don't have a close relationship with my family as my family has never been really close anyway and according to them I should just \"pray and get over it\".  I feel like I have tried everything: therapists, affirmations, meds, getting a pet (whom I feel doesn't like me either right now so I am trying to find a new loving home versus just dropping off at the pound). Tried watching the oprah life series thing; calling up various inpatient places just to be told that the beds are full or to get transferred continuously from one person to the other, callling the hotline to be put on hold forever just to end up speaking to the same guy who seems to be rushing me off the phone (I work in a helping field, so I realize that it can be demanding at times so I don't fault him and mental health sucks in this area, I know from trying to help others get help).  I have spent the last few days in my home or car thinking trying to find a purpose and reason for me to just stick around to feel miserable all the time.  I don't have any kids that I would be leaving behind or a significant other.  I just don't know what to do anymore\n",
      "suicide - Suicide being logical?First of all: Apologies for my English. Didn't really speek it since I graduated from school last year. \n",
      "\n",
      "Does anyone know the idea of suicide being kind of logical, when it's like the only reasonable way of thinking about your future? Since I've gratuaded from school last year I tried to work in a supermarket and started to study a subject which I really liked at that time. Started with my driver's licence, too. First, I stopped working because I got more nervous (and tired at the same time) with every shift. Then I skipped more and more classes at my university and eventually stopped going there at all. Around that time I got my driver's licence, but due to me being nervous I never got to drive that much to get some practice. I basically cut off every \"duty\" that forced me to leave the house and interact with people and therefore it developed into a cicle and my \"anxiety\" (souds kind of weird to use this term, but I can't find a better description of being extremely worried about everyone and everything and having no energy to do something about it at the same time) got even worse. Now I'm starting to meet friends more often again and I made up a plan of other classes I could visit at my university (e.g. to change subjects), but now I've got chest pain which makes it nearly impossible to work out and my motivation for visiting other classes slowly fades away. I'm more and more aware of the fact that everything I put my energy into basically goes to shit in the end. No progress in working out, still not a sign of social skills or self respect though I try to interact with friends (or even strangers) as much as possible. I think I let my parents down every time I don't have the energy and/or courage to do something important (although they seem to be interested and understanding they're both extremely stressed at the time). Never had a girlfriend at the age of 19. Had this, whatever it was, with a girl for about 1,5 years, in the end, she was just disappointed and I was hurt and felt kind of used. Regular problems of a regular person, especially considering my age, but I feel like I'm simply to weak to live with it, let alone do anything about it. To be honest, I just can't see me overcoming those \"fears\" or \"problems\" in the near future. Finding a subject I'm interested in, get a nice body, lose my fear/stress about everything/everyone, get a healthy relationship. I just can't imagine me being capable of solving any of these problems. I may sound like an extreme coward (atleast that's what I think it seems like), but before I hurt/disappoint anyone else or get hurt/disappointed (mostly by myself) once again, I think it would be the best - and in this case most logical - way to just end it when there's no sign of something getting better in the near future. I'm not even whiny or over-emotional at this point (which I'm often enough, believe me), it just sounds like the least \"annoying\"/stressful way to solve all my problems at once. \n",

Throughout high school I fantasized about death and would often purposefully put myself in dangerous situations such as sitting on the edge of a window or something silly like that. I guess it was not really anything serious as an attempt, but the fantasy felt extremely soothing and comforting in a sense. In uni I felt less like that, when I was dating my former significant other, who had MDD and had had multiple attempts, including experiences of hospitalization. I didnt quite understood what they were feeling back then I guess because my depression wasn't as serious as what they were experiencing.

I feel like I’m too much of a wuss and too lazy and stupid to do it properly. I’ve been in and out of treatment for years, on and off meds, in and out of therapy. Nothing makes much of a difference. The world is terrifying. I’m anxious almost all of the time. I have panic attacks all the time. I also have anorexia. I often say that I’m not depressed and I almost always lie about not having suicidal thoughts because if I say I get depressed or have the thoughts doctors get locked on and focus on that and giving me antidepressants and talking about low mood and those things are the least distressing of my mental symptoms. I hate all of their meds. I don’t want any of them. They’ve always either made things worse or not worked at all. I am a burden to my loved ones. My partner has to cook all my meals for me a freeze them for when she’s away because I’m too useless to do it myself (sometimes I think that’s just because I’m too lazy). My sister has her own mental health issues and has been staying with me because I haven’t been coping and I just freaked out and yelled at her and punched the car steering wheel. I didn’t mean to. She didn’t deserve that. My partner is away and I’m frantically offloading all my problems into her even though she can’t do anything and it’s just ruining her day. Basically I’m a piece of shit. My family would be sad if I died, the thing is I am starting to think it would be easier to have me go and them move on (however painful) than live with me hurting and holding them back forever in addition to the fact that I am just exhausted of being alive and I don’t want to continue on. \n",

I'm going to university in September and moving the the other side of the country and I should be excited to get away but I'm not, I'm just moving my problems elsewhere. I find it so hard to TRY and be productive and kind to people and even do simple things like shower or eat when it's all pointless anyway. I know everyone will say 'oh but you're only 18 it's just angst you won't feel like this when you're older' but that's not really helpful, if anything older people just settle for a life of humdrum and mediocrity which honestly sickens me. I think about this 24/7 and it's pushed me to the edge wherein I honestly feel it's better to die than to live like this. I ditch school frequently because of this feeling, have lost a stone from feeling it's pointless to eat and haven't cut my hair in months because even that is pointless, and I'm a boy so it's shoulder length now.

However, ever since the summer it had been a lot better and in the past few months I've been the least depressed I've been in a long long time. All my passions were back, I had motivation, I was even happy. Now I'm out of school, and I'm all alone again. At first I thought it'd be great and I'd start working on all the things I want to do, but I pretty much never leave the house now except for when I work (which isn't even very often). I don't really move as much and I think it's affecting me physically and mentally. I've lost all motivation and life seems meaningless again. I feel disgusting right now. I just want to end it. It's been so long since I've wanted to kill myself, but now I'm right back where I was. I'm going crazy being stuck inside all day but I have nowhere else to go. The few friends I have keep cancelling on me. I feel awful. If things keep going this way I don't know how much longer I can stand it.\n",

It caused me to have some trust issues, but I’ve actually moved on from this. But with recent events, I’m starting to feel like I’ve made no progress with my mental health.

Is it bad that I fantasize about dying and becoming a better person than I am now? I fantasize about me dying peacefully and becoming a whole different person. It brings me peace, in a weird way. I’ve accepted that I’m broken, and that I’m can’t be fixed. If I do kill myself, I dont think my sister will remember me. It’ll only be little spots of memories. In the years to come, she’ll probably forget my face too, which sucks. But I’ve pushed the pain away for too long. For example, I am so fucking skinny. I don’t understand why I don’t gain weight, but I don’t. I think when my mom was pregnant I didn’t get enough nutrients or something (my mom did run away while she was pregnant with me, so it makes sense if I was underdeveloped in someway) god bless my mother. She’s dealing with depression too. She’s cut herself before, I’ve seen the scars on her arms. I feel like if I died it would break her. Of course I don’t want that I love my family so much. But I just can’t do it anymore, man. Death seems to bring peace to me for some reason. Like, can you remember anything before you were born? Nope. If I don’t become someone else than I’ll probably will just be nothing. I guess that’s fine\n",

Even then I feel completely isolated at home. Neither of my parents did anything to prepare me for life. They let me do whatever I wanted which at the time was great but ruined my life. Now that I’m over 18 they just want to kick me out even if it mean me being homeless. Like how do you tell someone who has never went to high school a day in there life to move out. I can’t even face people do to how retracted my life has been. I don’t know anything and Iv never done anything. And I’m constantly reminded of that by my sibling who goes out of there way to tell me how worthless I am. The idea of leaving the house terrifies me. Even then like how?

      "suicide - I have no purpose in life and I'll never be successful.I've been depressed since 8 or 9 but it was a more innocent form of it. I never had friends in middle school and was bullied a decent amount. The only friends I ever made either found me annoying or got tired of me clinging to them. I have OCD and I definitely went overboard with following them around/frequent calls. I'm not like that now but it was a big part of why I never had friends. Then I got into high school and my depression multiplied. I was lucky to make it to school 3 or 4 days a week. I hardly ever did my homework and at the end of my sophomore year I missed a month and a half of the last bit of the school year. I got a chance to go to this really good charter school. The teachers were fantastic but I wasn't taking my meds at the time. I didn't do the homework for 3 months and ended up dropping out. I tried to commit suicide 2 times that year plus took aspirin to punish myself. In high school almost all of my few friends were online. One of the few friends I had met in 4th grade was always really popular and had an easy time making + keeping friends. I was always really envious of her.. She made friends on the second day of our freshman year and was still friends with them two years after that. I was spending a lot of time online and I met this girl that I became best friends with. I ended up dating her and we knew each other for less than 4 months before we cut things off. It took me more than two years to not regularly think of her anymore. She literally would keep me up at night and make me feel sick because I would remember all the stuff she said to me. I stopped being friends with her in December of 2012. 2013 rolled around and I felt like I could get my shit together. I stopped starving myself (I was severely underweight) and eventually gained almost 140 pounds over the course of two and a half years. It had to do with my current medicine plus I started eating more. I'm now stuck with really noticeable deep stretch marks all over my entire body. It was really hard to go from 83 pounds to 200+ and it made me hate myself so much more. Going back to 2013, later that year I met my current best friend plus started dating someone. I felt pretty happy but I broke up with that person the same year. In 2014 I started being friends with this person that eventually became my other best friend. As of two months ago I'm no longer friends with him as well as his boyfriend. I lost 5 friends this year, 3 of which I was really close to. I'm turning 19 in less than a month and I still haven't gotten my GED. I can't drive, in fact I haven't even sat behind the wheel of a car EVER. I have no motivation, no happiness, and I hate my life so much. I forgot to mention my housing situation. My house is so messy it doesn't feel like home. It's just somewhere where I exist. I get a lot of frustration from living in a place where I'm constantly bumping into stuff. I just want all the stuff to disappear so I can have people over at my house. My mom always says that if I even do 20 minutes of cleaning every day it'll make a difference. I can't do anything for myself and I'll never survive without my mom. I don't have basic life skills and I've never done laundry. I let soda cans pile up because I only get up to get a new soda and don't discard the old can. It honestly feels like it'll never get better. I'm not cut out to be an adult let alone a successful adult. I'm sorry that this post is a mess. I'm so tired of being alive. I hate feeling like my few friends don't even like me that much. I only have one friend I can hang out with in person. I know that suicide is inevitable for me but I don't know how or when it'll occur.\n",

      "non-suicide - To everyone who thinks racism only happens to blsck people Ok so a little context: im an american singaporean and i live in singapore. (Btw sorry if i make any spelling errors, my giant fingers prevent me from typing properly) here in singapore, they government doesnt really tolerate racism, like in our nation's pledge theres  stuff abt equality. A lot of racism or hurtful talk abt my being american occurs at school usually. Im allowed to go to local schools cus im part singaporean, so most of my classmates are singaporeans.\n",

Anyways, he claimed there was a guy he met while playing minecraft who was being racist and specifically saying, \"I HATE SINGAPOREANS THEY ARE THE WORST. ALSO IM AMERICAN\". Like im not joking, thats literally what my classmate claimed the guy he met online said. Im not denying that it was true, but really thats just way too specific. But moving on, that somehiw managed to get most of the class angry at me cus \"all americans are racist\" like dude. First of all, that was an obvious lie.\n",

Ik that every country has a stereotype nobody likes, and people sometimes use them jokingly, but idc if its a joke, stereotypes shoudlnt be followed. As an asian american, i typically get taunted with \"asians are smart\" and \"americans are fat asses\" stereotypes. For the fat one, as someone who is EXTREMELY concious about my looks and body, i found it offensive that i have to live almost everyday at school getting called fat. I have told my classmates, the main source of this bullying, to knock it off, but every morning when i get to school im hit with about 50 of them. Personally, the smart stereotypes dont bother me too much, but there have been times when i just felt horrible because of them. Im not the sharpest tool in the shed and often dont do well in my exams, so whenever i tell anyone who isnt a fellow singaporean about my results, i get screamed at cause \"asians are supposed to be smart af and always do well\".

      "I’ve been sick for ten months. One day, I was fine, the next I woke up with insane dizziness—like being in an F16 doing barrel rolls that never stopped—and nausea that was off the charts. I was so dizzy I could barely move. I couldn’t get up, walk around, bathe myself or even get to the bathroom. I had ammonia burns on my bottom for months due to lying in my own urine all day, too sick to move. I was so nauseous, I felt like vomiting every second of every day. It was so bad I couldn’t sleep. I would be awake for days at a time until finally falling asleep from sheer exhaustion. I could barely eat. I could only barely manage to drink a sip of water or small bite of food every ten minutes. If I tried to eat any more or faster, I would dry heave. I was so dehydrated, I had to go to the ER 7 times. Each time, the ER doctors told me I just needed to eat. Once, They tried to force me to drink potassium, only for me to start dry heaving after less than ten sips of it. I ended up losing 34lbs in 3.5 months. I had shortness of breath, pain in my chest, blood pressure drop upon standing and numbness in my legs and hands. I tried over half a dozen medications. Nothing helped. It went on like this for six months until I spontaneously began to get better. My dizziness lessened to the point that I was able to take a shower again and get out of diapers. My nausea lessened to the point I was able to start regaining weight. Over the next four months, I *slowly* began to get better. My dizziness evolved and although it was still annoying, I could deal with it. My nausea dwindled to the point that I was only having small bursts of mild nausea a couple times a day. Again, annoying, but compared to what it had been before, I thought I was finally on the road to recovery. Until about five days ago. Suddenly, my nausea returned. Not 24/7 like it had been before, but enough to where I couldn’t eat much without feeling sick and don’t really want to eat anyway. Sometimes, I don’t have any dizziness or nausea for several hours, then a sudden intense burst of nausea will crop up, usually accompanied by a tightening in my throat and tongue and sometimes just short of gagging. Other times, my dizziness will crop up. Sometimes it’s both. Sometimes I can’t even drink water because I feel too sick. Sometimes even thinking about food makes me ill. My doctors have not been able to figure out the problem. And none of them seem to be in an all-fired hurry to help me figure it out either. Ive has to beg for help after basically being left to die, to starve to death. Ive been waiting seven months to see a doctor who *may* be able to help and still have another two months to go until that appointment. By that time, I will have been sick for a year. I’m so freaking tired of feeling sick. I’m so tired of doctors blaming it all on “anxiety”. This isn’t living. This is existing and I’m miserable. I’ve hardly been sick a day in my life and BAM, my world is turned upside down overnight and no one can or will help. Often, I feel to nauseous to cry. I just want to freaking die.\n",
      "suicide - With my birthday coming up, I'm reminiscing a lot My teenage years were the worst years of my life. I spent years trying to drug my way out of my problems and even tried ending it all when I was 14. I was constantly falling out with friends and switching schools. Only one of my friends (from probably dozens) has remained all these years. All in all, I was a miserable little rat. Still, I look back at these years as the ones I got away with the wildest stuff, really found who I was, and began to understand the world for what (I think) it truly is. I'm still so far and I still feel like a child. With about a month before my 20th birthday, I feel so bittersweetly nostalgic. I wish I had partied more instead of staying in every day. I wish I had gotten into trouble while I would still have been a \"stupid kid\". Now I am left with stupid memories of lying in bed crying about my life and crying because I was scared I would end it all once it got hard. Well, it is hard. I \"should\" have killed myself this year but of course I didn't. I have a life to live and there are people that I wish to keep seeing. I have things I want to do. So funny, I spent those years in fear of myself. \n",

I'll spend the rest of my life working in a cubicle for 8 hours a day, earning worthless pieces of paper with which I might end up wiping my ass in a couple of years. Talking of college, chances are I'll drop out and will never finish my degree due to my intense lack of motivation (failing all my core classes). In fact, I hate the field of my study, but I love my family to a point that I cannot disappoint them by switching majors (my father is very excited about my program. He loves peeking over my desk and seeing what I do, and always pushes a little laughter of excitement afterwards). I'd go as far as to say that they're the only reason I'm still here. I'm still alive because I simply don't want to make them suffer by suiciding. Motivation doesn't work either.

I'm too much of a pussy to hurt myself. I'm always told that to become a man, and to never cry. I'm always so kind to my family members, but they always treat me like shit, ignore me, scream at me, threaten to kill themselves.

I can't handle being disrespected, so I smashed the fucking door down by kneeing it multiple times. After that I just sat down in my room bleeding, I heard my family rush upstairs screaming threats to take away the only things I find enjoyment in life, yet I felt so good after smashing the door and looking at my mangled leg. I'm too afraid to intentionally cut myself, so I play with sharp balisong knives, break shit with my body, get into amateur boxing matches, etc. I'm just too fed up with my life. My family is lower class so I'm sure I won't be able to afford a therapy, as my parents don't even believe depression is a real thing. The little money we have is going to my sister's college, and I know for sure I won't be able to go to college. My future is so shit, financial crisis is biting my ass every single corner. I'm becoming an adult soon, but I have no plans to grow up straight. I wouldn't care if I was an alcoholic, or a crackhead. My only enjoyment is going to the boxing gym to relieve my anger, and playing on my pc. They took away my gym membership, and they shattered my monitor. I want to just end it all at this point. My entire life is just pain, from when I was a kid and my uncle would touch my penis, to my sister and mother's constant harassment, neglect, and the only person I love, my father, is suffering from heart problems but continues to smoke a pack a day.

      "&gt;26 November 2012: Life has gotten very hard lately. It's hard to wake up in the morning. All the little things that made me happy are slowly turning to diminishing memories. She and I are falling apart at the seams... quickly. My one constant rock I've had for the past year is getting harder and harder to reach out to. I think about our future together and it's starting to get bleaker and bleaker. It's depressing to think that the woman you love and want to marry is slowly turning into this unknown person - someone you used to know everything about and now know nothing about. It's time to be honest. I'm coming to terms with it: I have decided that I want to die by my own hand. I don't know how I'm going to do it, but these thoughts are too much to handle. My family doesn't love me as much as they used to. My fiancee only looks at me with remorse or fear that one morning I'll turn up dead. Honestly, she has the right. I live far away from what I used to call home. I have no friends here. I'm far into debt. I don't want her to have to pay for anything once I do it. So it's a good thing we're not married. Once I save up enough for some of the after costs, I'll put the money somewhere and write a note with the details. I don't know how I'll do it yet. Too afraid of guns. Probably euthanasia. Maybe I'll crawl to the top of a mountain w/no supplies. Maybe through myself off the bridge. Who knows. But it's for the best. I'm tired...\n",

      "suicide - Just had the scare of my lifeYesterday was a shitshow of unfortunate events. It started out normally, and my sister was about to leave for a trip to a beach with this boy we'll call J. My sis and I are still under my mother's roof and so we abide by her rules. Though she has been very lenient with my sis since she's only recently been driving and is accumulating more friends thanks to her job at where people of all shapes-and-sizes work. My mother doesn't expect to know all of her friends, but as a mother does, she is nervous about her hanging out with boys alone. I totally understand why she feels that way of course, but the paranoia drives my mother up the wall. \n",
      "This is usually how these sorts of things go; my sis is invited to hang out with a friend which happens to be male. Sometimes on short notice these plans happen and my mother is a little rustled by the sudden plans. (She's the type that plans way in advance..) My sis loves to indulge in make-up and cute clothes that my mom thinks might bring a guy to get some.. ideas. But my sis texts frequently and comes back home safe and sound and my mother is put at ease. But yesterday, oh boy was yesterday a domino effect of abnormalities.\n",
      "\n",
      " So, like all the times before, my sis left for a spontaneous hang out with this guy J. This guy happens to be one of the guys my mom and I have not had the pleasure of meeting. My sis knows J has a crush on her, but she's unsure if she replicates the feeling. If my mom knew J likes her that way she would have a heart attack, but I kept that to myself hoping she'd make smart decisions with this anonymous boy.  Well, the first thing that sparked concern was her lack of response to my texts, snapchats and phone calls for hours on end This is unusual, but happens sometimes if shes busy or driving. Nothing too bad, but this loud knock erupting from our front door was significantly more worrisome. It was a cop, carrying my sisters license plate. I could see my mom trembling as she stepped outside to speak with the cop. My mom knew, but I was oblivious to the fact that cops often come to the door of relatives who may have suffered injury or death with the license plate of the victims car, if the accident occurred in a car crash. My mother came back and told me that the cop found this plate in a parking lot that traces back to my sis and our home address. I called my sister multiple times with no response or sign shes seen any of our messages, hours after the first batch from earlier. So naturally the panic rose. The next thing to worry us was this app we installed call life360 that tracks our whereabouts. My sister was not at the beach like she told us, but at some random park near a large construction site. I kept calling and calling until she picked up. But instead of my sister on the phone, it was a male with a heavy Russian accent. My heart raced so fucking hard I was actually shaking. I asked where my sister was and he said he never heard of her. I was afraid. So fucking afraid I wasn't sure what to say to him. For a split second however I heard a girly giggle in the background. I said I heard her and to give her the phone. It was J, pretending to be someone else too..prank me I guess? Ha ha funny right..? They laughed but I began to cry uncontrollably. My sis asked what was wrong and I told her everything, and I asked why she wasn't responding to mother and I and why she wasn't where she told us she'd be. She said she didn't hear her phone going off because it was on silent, (which is unlike her) and she said they decided to go to this park on the way to the beach instead. For whatever reason she thought telling us she wasn't going to the beach as originally planned wasn't important? Again, which is highly unlike her! She always sends a quick text of where she's going, but today of all days she thought it wasn't important? Today of all days she had her phone on silent? But I was so thankful to hear her on the phone and that she was alright. But fuck, what are the chances of all of these things happening one after the other? First I couldn't get ahold of her, then the cop, even longer with no response, then life360 shows her at a random location, and then this jackass decided to pull a prank on me over the phone? What the hell. It was all very jarring, but she eventually came home and we were all put at ease.\n",

This experience shook me by the shoulders and showed me what it's like, for even a moment to believe my sister was in danger and the possibility that I wouldn't see her again. I thought about how my death could shake those I love and care for. I always knew if I gave into my suicidal thoughts and offed myself, those people would grieve, but facing the possibility that I may not see my dearest sister ever again was absolute hell. It made me think that maybe this is the feeling they would feel for me, even if I did it to myself? Anyways, it just made me think and reflect a bit. I'm still planning on suicide in the upcoming years but it gave me a lot to think about.\n",

For context, my appetite has been like this since I was around 14-15, I'm 16 now. I don't know exactly, but based on my most recent measurements (a fair while ago), I'm around 5'8-9\" and 120 pounds so pretty average. I haven't gained much weight in the past couple years actually, despite my large appetite. My diet isn't horrible but it's not \"healthy\" either, I do eat a fair amount of junk food, often because there generally isn't much to eat around the house outside of the meals that we bring home or that my mom cooks. After that, there can be leftovers which I eat occasionally but sometimes I don't feel like eating them or straight up don't like them. I don't have a lot to work with either since i usually just have a bit of spare change so all I can really get is junk food.\n",

      "This is gonna sound cliche, but it works I promise. If you walk with confidence (i.e not cowering to the side when someone walks by) you’re already half way there. If you *act* confident, people will see you as confident, if people see you as confident they’ll treat you like you’re confident, and if they treat you like you’re confident you’ll feel confident. This is the most important step and even if you don’t follow the others, I’d still recommend using this. \n",

      "Step two: your worst nightmare isn’t that powerful .\n",
      "It’s true that (most) teenage guys fears teenage girls above all else. You’re brain is hard wired to pick up tiny social cues that you might not even notice. You’ll naturally be subconsciously worried about what they think. The thing to remember though is that their opinions on you don’t mean jack shit. They’re just as awkward as they think you are. This is probably one of the harder steps but learn to forget they exist, their stares mean nothing to you.\n",

No matter how well you execute steps one and two, it’ll all fall apart the moment you think something like “oh fuck do I look awkward!?” If you think about stuff like that you’ll start to show tiny details of worry that the brain will subconsciously pick up. The best thing to help with this is thinking the opposite. Think about how confident you are, you’re the center of your own world and that’s all that matters.\n",

      "suicide - I am having severe Career and Life Issues and I am losing all hope dont know how much more I can take it Hello Reddit, I (M26) have been a student for 8 years now and as depressing as that is, I have pressed forward in this major. However, I am really starting to doubt myself, after I get my bachelor’s degree, I feel I will not be able to get a job. I am still living at home, no car, no job I've gained weight and am losing my hair. When I was 21, I got a petty theft charge because I was trying to save money for my family and education instead of relaxing on loans, so I stole from my place of business after I got desperate and tired of struggling and I feel like that has also hurt my job aspects as well. I struggle with suicide almost every other day and am taking meds for it I was diagnosed with PTSD and Major Depressive Disorder. I was raped as a child by family for years and have been trying to cope with that for years its crippled my ability to have any meaningful relationships every GF I have had has either cheated or left me and I don’t really have a family although I have 2 close friends I feel like they don’t like me anymore or I am just a bother or charity case. When it comes to school, I am not very good at anything in this major, programming, art, game design I left community college(graduated) in 2017 took a stress break in 2018 and game back this year to University. I feel so lost I am 26 and am running out of time in life I feel so old and I that I peaked at 17. I had interest in law, but I can’t take those types of classes or transfer over because I am junior and it’s too late now. I feel that I would be better suited to do law to be an officer instead of game design plus I could use it for more things but because of the misdemeanor I feel like I would be denied . As has time marched on I have heard how hard it is to get into the game industry and with such a limited degree even if did get better at programming I couldn't use the degree for anything else but games I live in Maryland there isn't much in the way of jobs for this degree except Bethesda. I thought I wanted to do this but I haven't had many good professors for programming and learning on my own has always been hard for me I need special help and I learn better in class rooms and hands on but there are no tutors. Most of my classes are online and I am not really learning anything since they expect me to know what I am doing already when I am put in groups for projects, I feel slow, dumb and useless. I have no Idea what to do now I feel like I have wasted these 8 years and I have nothing to show for it I feel old and at the end of my rope. I am almost out of Financial Aid and in huge debt of 60,000 because my parents said I needed to help the family out and I would just give them all or most of my refund checks, I wasn't able to get my driver’s licenses until now because I had no one to teach me as my dad refused to and I had a friend teach me and I got it but I can’t afford a car. Being a full-time student and having a misdemeanor of petty theft no one wants to hire me, and I just don’t know what to do anymore I feel stupid and that its too late to make something of myself and it would just be easier for me and everyone if I just finally just jumped into traffic. I feel like my existence is pointless and that nothing bad things and bad choices have been made I have no talent or skills and I have nothing to offer society, I am tired and I just like I have no future and nothing to look forward to anymore I'm scared and tired and I just not sure what to do anymore or If I can even go on anymore. \n",

      "suicide - I’m not sure what to do.This is my first time opening up my feelings to anything that breathes, so I should mention that my life is pretty good. I’m in good physical health, my worst mental health conditions would be autism and anxiety. I’m pretty young and not even in high school yet, and I’m homeschooled. I have a loving family that isn’t dealing with any hardships outside of what everyone else is this year. I don’t have many real problems at all. My only problems ever started this year. Like everyone, I haven’t been doing too well with 2020. Everything I liked that was even slightly productive was either canceled or made Zoom-centric, the latter of which I hate and find even worse than simply refraining from the activity entirely. However, I predicted earlier this year that I’d feel much worse when the holidays started. I was right. I felt more sad than usual on Halloween night just because of all the reminders of what’s going on. However, November has been even worse. I’ve felt gradually more hopeless since, and I’ve begun to despise myself more and more, unable to see anything good about myself. For the past few days, I’ve been considering suicide more and more, feeling particularly awful today. Today is Thanksgiving, and I wasn’t able to see any of my other family members due to social distancing. I like nothing else about this holiday, but my family and the rest of the world has been preparing as usual, as well as talking about what would normally go on. Which has been triggering me all day. Like I said, I have anxiety and I’ve begun to strongly hate myself to the point where even I feel like I’m really just fishing for attention by making this post. That’s why I’m scared to open up to my family. I feel like they’ll either say I’m just “being emo” (I wear normal clothing and think existence has meaning, but I’m generally a pessimist) or (like me) think I’m just being a manipulative piece of shit who wants attention. I don’t know what to do.\n",

      "suicide - I don't know what to doHi, I don't really know why I'm posting this I'm just fucking fed up with everything. I'm 19f, live in the UK and my life has just been a complete downward fucking spiral since the day I was born. My mum was an alcoholic who abused me for my entire childhood, of course I still loved her and whatever so when I watched her die from alcohol related multiple organ failure it fucked me up and sent me into a pit of depression, even though I have been self harming since the age of 7 and Ive had suicidal thoughts my entire life. I have lost almost every job I've ever had, the first because my boss found out I knew that he was shagging my aunt while he was dating his now wife, the second because I was pregnant and hormonal and showed up late to a shift, and the last one because I was so depressed I couldn't even bring myself to get out of bed. I'm in about £3000 debt with no possible way to pay it off. I'm on benefits because I can't go to work due to covid, even when I do go back I'm just working in a dead end shitty bar job with no future. Today I learnt that I will never be able to achieve my dream of joining the raf because I'm asthmatic, autistic and obviously the aforementioned depression. I had a miscarriage in August and I was pressured into an abortion in October because my partner said he would be miserable for the rest of his life if I made him have a baby. All I have ever wanted since I was a child was to have my own family because I never got that family unit when I was young and I know I could be a damn good parent if I wasn't so fucked up in the head but even that was taken away from me. Besides, how can I even think of starting a family when I'm so fucked up and have no money and no future. I just don't see the fucking point anymore, I will never amount to anything, I'll never fucking do all the shit I want to do and in a few years time everyone will move on and forget about me like they have with my mum. I'm so fucking fed up with everything I just wish I had the fucking balls to do anything about it so instead I just lie in bed every day in agony because I don't want to be here but I can't find the courage to end it. Maybe I will one day, I hope so - just to put an end to this fucking misery.\n",

that's childsplay. the viruses of old were created by much less skilled hackers that didn't even have the source code of your operating system but now microsoft's spaghetti code is out in the open everybody can see it and your computer is more screwed then an unchaperoned toddler on epstein's island dring a bill clinton visit your kernel is going down faster then a golden retriever at the atf's headquarters. now before you go into full panic mode and start freaking out there are some solutions for you to continue using your computer, my personal recommendation is to load up dban, completely remove any trace of windows, or any other proprietary bullshit operating system that came with your computer, and then install gentoo and use that for the rest of eternity to do your computing. if you can't figure out how to use gentoo then you have the option of using linux mint which is another approved gnu/linux operating system that is more noob friendly and kind of similar to windows in the layout just minus all the horrible bullcrap and spaghetti code that makes up windows. if you can't figure out how to use linux mint then you should just sell your computer, purchase a horse and buggy, and go be amish in a field somewhere because it's no longer safe for you to have a computer or really any electronic device for that matter. hopefully the many years of you beating off to cam girls will translate into good butter churning skills so you can earn a living as an amish person. if you fail to comply you are going to get updates forcefully pushed to your operating system which has been happening for a while now because let's face it, microsoft has never even heard of the word consent, but instead of these updates coming from microsoft themself, bill gates himself, they are going to be coming from the hacker known as 4chan and you will soon experience strange behavior in your operating system, internet explorer or microsoft edge or whatever the hell they're calling that crap these days will be replaced with pale moon or a similar furry browser. every day the wallpaper on your desktop is going to become an anime girl that is more and more lewd and vaguely underage as time goes on all of your home videos will be replaced by forceful tentacle hentai, all of your family photos are going to be replaced with pepes that become more and more racist as time goes on, oh and also your webcam will permanently live stream to liveleak so watch out for chinese truck drivers and off-duty brazzilian police officers. now i don't want to hear any of you wondering all of a sudden oh woe is me why does something like this have to happen to me no you've been warned for years and years about the dangers of proprietary software and yet you did nothing, richard stallman went out of his way to make speeches at college campuses all across the world even doing some in spanish so that he can reach a wider audience and going days without a proper meal this man had to subsist on nutrients from the bottom of his foot and yet you did nothing, edward snowden revealed that bioluminescent goverment agents were living in your computer watching you watch cam girls and browse old memes that washed up on the shores of reddit all under the guise of stopping terrorism and had to flee the united states and go live in a russian airport bathroom and yet you continued using windows purchasing a new copy every few years making bill gates a gorillianare in the process so that he could get ot his end goal of injecting windows updates directly into the bloodstream of every person in the world and newborn babies and yet you kept on using windows even though each new version removed more and more of your rights and became more and more bloated but now 4chan, the hacker, has taken it to the extreme. you will no longer be using your operating system it will se you, it will require a minimum of 2 terabytes of ram and a quantum cpu just to load up the crypto miner that's going to be required to boot your operating system. now alternatively i have heard directly from the hacker known as 4chan that for one bitcoin you can purchase a subscription of windows xp yotsuba edition which will have most of the restrictions removed however your wallpaper will still be set to a lewd vaguely underage anime girl and your browser will be permanently set to [4channel.org](https://4channel.org), uh, also microsoft word is going to be replaced with vim so good luck doing your homework on there hopefully you know how to quit out of it. you have been warned now go install gentoo or suffer the consequences or like i said sell all your electronics and go be amish because the amish don't get computer viruses\n",

      "suicide - I feel like I have the worst life ever. I hope somebody reads this.I had 2 really good friends in Kindergarten. I never saw them afterwards before I went to private school. It took me nearly 2 decades to get another friend. I feel like I'm the only person on the planet to go through elementary school, middle school, high school, and college without a single friend. If a genie would grant me a wish. I would automatically wish to relive life, but always with a real friend. I wouldn't care if I had to relive life in the worst living conditions in the world. I feel like my whole life has been wasted because I'm so lonely. I went to more birthday parties uninvited than invited. I love concerts and and sporting events. Almost every-time I've gone to one, I've gone alone. I was so lonely I sat next to people, who in respect were not my friends. I think they only let me sit next to them because I had no friends.  Even worse at some point, I think some people gave me rides to church not because I was their friend, but because they felt sorry for me.  On my last day of high school I remember crying in the parking lot because everybody else had friends and everybody went home with friends to celebrate the last day of school. I called my dad to pick me up from the middle school because I didn't want to explain to him why I was the only one in the parking lot.  I remember in 2016 I was so desperate for a friend I went to meetup after meetup. It took about 10 meetups where nobody liked me before I finally got a friend. The ironic thing is if I wasn't so desperate. If I quit going to meetups after my 10th pointless one, my friend drought will probably still be going on 25 years later. My friend moved 1.5 years to be with his girlfriend. I remember that for once, I was going to have somebody to hang out with during New Years Eve. Then my friend got a girlfriend. I'm dreading this New Years Eve. I am going to be alone again. The worst part is that I've o close to making friends in the past. I've met people. They liked me. In less than a couple of months, they get bored of me. I feel like the biggest loser ever. How many people can say it took them 2 decades to find a friend, more than 5 to get my drivers licence, 10 years to get a part-time job, and more than 5 years out of college to get my first full-time job? I wish I could live life over again. FYI I drove all they way across country to Sillicon Valley to find a full-time job. I got one at the airport, where I also lived in the terminals for a couple of months to save money. Now I work at a big tech company, get paid well, and lively extremely cheaply with my coworker. I can't believe I was in high school when the labor market collapsed, and it literally took me all the way until the end of the bull-market to get my first full-time job. I don't think anybody's life is more pathetic than mine. I just wished at some point in my life, making a friend wouldn't be so hard. Most people figured out how to do it before they turn 10. I'm almost 30, and I'm still a disaster.\n",

We usually say \"goodnight :) &lt;3\" or something like that when we go to bed, but then she stopped doing that with me. I kept talking to her and then yesterday I asked how she was feeling. She basically told me she liked her friend. (she's bi) and I met her friend before, and well  I was at school and I was being a big baby. I was trying to hold back the tears but I just had to go to the bathroom to let them out. She kept saying please don't cry, and I just couldn't stop. She told me she didn't like me like that anymore but hopefully we can still be friends. I want her to be happy, but I mean I'm not. I liked this girl more than any other girl, which sucked. Whenever I see her name i picture her beautiful face and I just feel like crying. Today she hasn't opened any snaps, and didn't respond when I just said \"goodnight\" last night. She left me on open. I said good morning today and no response. I think I need to ask a doctor for a new heart, cuz this one's broken.\n",

      "non-suicide - Hi I’m sad lonely please help I’m a junior and I’m on my third high school. My closest friends right now are from my middle school and a few from my second high school. Issue is I keep fucking moving and they all live on the other side of the country so all I can do is play games with them but it’s not the same. I just started going to school in person and it’s so much worse cause now I have to watch groups of people that have been friends for years have fun while I’m just a lonely loser. I made all my friends at my last high school by joining track but it’s too late in the year to join anything. I’ve tried to talk to groups of people and although they are nice, they have all been friends for a while and I just feel like a third wheel. I talked to one girl when I took the act before in person and I liked her but i haven’t been able to find her again and I don’t know if she is in person and I don’t even remember her name. Making friends feels like a lose cause. In class nobody talks to each other. So few people are just openly nice to the people sitting near them. Starting a school mid year and moving is just killing my mentality. Nothing is enjoyable anymore as I’ve lost all my extracurriculars. I just feel so pathetic. Everyone at my last school was so nice and nobody was ever alone and this school is just not like that because it’s so big. I hate it so much and I still have a whole year and two months left here.

Started dating a girl 5 months ago and she has been the best girl I've ever been with and now I've fucked everything up. I hate who I am and I've always known I would one day kill myself so why bother prolonging it anymore?\n",

She's made me happier than anyone else and I couldn't believe what a girl I had found. But for some reason, I knew I'd fuck it up. It's what I do best. I know this is not as bad as some other's situations, but this is my weak point. Nothing else in my life, death of friends &amp; family, having been molested, never knowing who my father was until I was 16, etc., nothing else could hurt me like this does.\n",

      "Well, I told her why I started talking to her after about a month of dating and she has felt that I have only stayed with her for sex since then. I tell her I love her everyday (I really, really do) and I try my best to prove her that it's not why. Lately, I had been a little overprotective. I got mad over stupid things almost daily and was just not feeling quite right, like I needed space, but I was in denial about it and didn't give myself that. 4 days ago I got crazy mad she got off of work for the night and didn't tell me. (She couldn't since she was at youth group) She had left there with some friends and pulled up where I was getting ice cream for my brother's birthday and was excited to see me. I went home and said stupid things of how I don't matter and how I was nothing to her. And, started drinking.\n",

I haven't eaten since Thursday (excluding the meal my friend just forced me to eat) and I can't sleep, and if I do there are just nightmares. I almost did it last night, why, I don't know but I decided that each day I would write a farewell letter to someone close. If I ran out of letters before she contacts me... That's it. I'm going to cut my wrists in our shower (to avoid a mess) and leave the notes outside the door, telling my parents not to open the door so they don't have to see what's on the other side. If I could take back what I've done, I would. I haven't cut, in hopes that she'll come back, but there's only so much I can do. \n",

I still thought she was joking, so I said “Huh?” Then she took her big scissors, kicked my door and ran into my room. She waved the scissors in front of me and near my mouth and yelled that I should apologize. I know this sounds insane and made up. And I can’t believe it just happened as I’m writing this. I did apologize her. Then she yelled even more because “you’re not genuine enough and say ‘I’m sorry’ like a robot,” I apologized again and again, but she still wasn’t satisfied. She stood and yelled for 30 minutes until she was fully convinced that I know what I have done wrong. Even when I cry for forgiveness, she says I’m acting like a self-pitying drama queen.\n",

      "suicide - Failed suicideI've been suffering from severe depression for the past year and a half, and I just woke up, home alone, from a failed suicide attempt. At the moment I feel no emotions whatsoever, but i know that tomorrow, if i don't get some help, I will most likely try a much more \"successful\" attempt, and I feel like if I were to call someone, like the suicide hotline, to get help, I would just come off as \"too calm\" or something like that. It's really hard for me to put into words. I guess the rational side of me knows that it's terrible what I'm trying to do, and it would affect my friends and family severly, but I feel like this is my only way out of this hell on earth that I'm in right now and I don't know what to do. I just have so many problems right now, whether they're self inflicted or brought upon me, that I can't take life anymore. Please help. I feel like this might be my last chance.\n",

I don't really have anyone else to talk to because some of my friends are understanding,  but don't have experience with a situation like this/don't know her,  while the others don't really like her/seem not to care very much.

It all started in school as a kid i was an awkward child in a small town, where you grow a reputation quickly, i was quickly known as the kid to stay away from if you want to be popular. I made my peace with it i thought maybe in high school i would have another chance, I quickly found out that wasnt the case, i got bullied like crazy in high school to the point that i really started considering it for the first time. I found out how to tie a noose and i found some rope in my dads workshop and tied one and kept it in my room and for long periods of time i would just look at it considering. I ended up not doing it thinking to myself, It must get better once school is over, that is what everyone keeps telling me they cant be lying right one day its going to get better. Then school ended with me never really having a friend in my life outside of my dog, never once having a sleep over or going to another kids house but i made it threw high school. Ontop of all that BS with just being a lonely piece of shit i have always been a failure when it comes to any kind of academics or skills that would lead to some kind of career, I am 25 years old and have never made over 10k a year, no kind of post secondary and no prospects to speak of what so ever. Still living with my mother and she wants me out more and more with each passing month, nothing saved to speak of, at this point i have moved on from the noose and i think about a cliff near my house and have decided when i do it it will be there as i imagine it being the least painful. To add some more shit ontop i am asexual or at least i think i am, as far as i can tell i have never been attracted to a man or women in my life time, never been on a date of course since i have never had a friend and everyday i just want to jump more, there is no enjoyment, no fun just dread of being a poor failure that will be homeless once my mom has had enough and has no chance as success in the future, the most successful future i can hope for is a trash apartment that i can pray i can afford on my cashier salary. I also just found out that I don't have a job anymore I was layed off for the winter and supposed to start again soon now I just found out they don't want me back so seems like just another reason to do it, when nothing good ever happens for you and it is just shit on shit on shit why keep going.

I usually don’t try to, but the anxiety and suicidal thoughts just really push me to the edge sometimes. Most of the time I go out I usually bring my dog (only to places dogs are allowed obviously) since I know that if I kill myself while I’m out then he’ll be sad and alone. I can’t even go out to do everyday tasks like going to the store or going to school without those feelings coming like a punch in the gut. I can’t breath. I can’t focus. The only thing I can think about is all the ways I can die ASAP. Since I have nothing with me I can use as an excuse not to. All of this has caused my stress levels to get so high that I practically burst into tears when I missed the bus today. Something so small caused me to cry for 20 minutes in the councilor’s office while she tried to figure out why I was so upset. I don’t know how much longer I can go on like this being unable to stop these intrusive thoughts 24/7. Broke my 1 year clean streak from cutting which was a huge disappointment. No one knows I cut though so it was just a personal loss. My antidepressants and anti anxiety medications aren’t cutting it and my clinic keeps pushing back and canceling my appointments. Nothing I can do about it since I’m 17. These have been going on for many many years so I’m surprised I made it this long, but I just don’t know how to stop this. I’ve never been this open with anyone other than my doctor so I guess that’s a good step. I could NEVER trust my family with this sort of information though since all they do is belittle me and ignore my existence anyways and this would only fuel that since I was my mom’s last kid before my dad left (he didn’t want parental responsibility over two kids so I just tried to take my brother and failed)... I don’t even feel like I’m actually living though. I just feel like I’m watching someone live on some sort of auto pilot while I’m in a purgatory.

Completely forgot new years was even close until a bud of mine brought it up a week before it happened. I think I’m getting too off topic and rambling so I’ll stop here.

      "First of all, I think the most important thing to say is that this is no one’s fault. No-one could have done anything to prevent this and it’s been a very long time coming. This isn’t just some impulsive decision; it’s something that I’ve wanted to do for a very long time. And I didn’t want to be talked out of this, or persuaded to keep on going for a bit longer, because the one recurring regret I’ve had throughout my life was not ending it sooner.\n",

      "Thank you to everyone who’s been there over the years, you know who you are. Even if it may not have seemed like I appreciated your help and support I just want you to know that I truly did. To my family: Thank you for everything. I love you all and I’m sorry I never said that to you until now. I’m desperately sorry to transfer my pain from myself to you, but please take solace knowing that my suffering is finally over and I am finally at peace on my own terms.\n",

      "I’m just sick and tired of carrying around so much pain with me. I’ve been unhappy for so long, as long as I can remember. And nothing helps. I don’t have coping mechanisms or things I can do or places I can go that help me escape, I am constantly trapped inside my own head with little to no control over my thoughts. And when things get bad, they’re really bad. Time seems to slow down and I’m just overwhelmed with the worst pain imaginable, and the only thing that helps me through that is thinking that one day I’ll end my life and it’ll all be over. And all I can think about in these moments is how I never want to ever go through this again, yet I get through it and then get my hopes up thinking things will be okay eventually only to go through it again and again, with each time being worse than the last.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don’t think I have the capacity to be ‘happy’. I don’t think I could ever be happy unless things in my life were absolutely perfect which is impossible. Even when things are ‘good’ and I should be ‘happy’ there’s always something that stops me from actually being happy. Whilst sometimes things are okay and I feel okay, being ‘okay’ isn’t enough to make up for how horrible I feel the rest of the time. I cannot think back to a time in my life where I’ve actually been happy for any prolonged period of time. So the concept of happiness just isn’t something I can really believe in.\n",
      "\n",
      "There’s nothing in life that actually appeals to me. I cannot and have not ever been able to envisage myself working full time. I have no motivation to do anything and even the smallest of things are a massive challenge to me. And the thing is, I don’t even care to change my situation. Yes, things could get better eventually but I’ll never be truly happy and the work and suffering I’d have to go through just to have a chance of feeling better does not seem worth it to me. And I’m so tired of trying and getting my hopes up only to just end up back at square one because falling from a height is so much more painful than falling on flat ground. Things could get better, yes, but equally they could get worse. Or they could stay the exact same and I’ll go through the same agonising cycle for the rest of my years only wishing I’d ended things sooner.\n",
      "\n",
      "I could never be happy being who I am. I’m not funny enough, or smart enough, or attractive enough, or chatty enough to be happy within myself. In every single social situation I feel this immense pressure to be interesting and funny and maintain conversation and it’s horrible. I find myself comparing myself to absolutely everybody and I’m just left 90% of the time feeling absolutely awful. The other 10% of the time where I feel good about who I am I just think about that other 90% and how I can’t be like this forever. And I just can’t ‘accept who I am’. It’s like being stuck in the wrong body, except in my case it’s being stuck in the wrong mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "I feel so alone in the world. I feel like I’m different to everyone, not like anyone else at all and unable to truly form a connection with anyone. There’s no one I can ever just be around and feel comfortable with without having to worry about what to say or how to act. I feel this general disconnect from people and society and constantly feel like I’m some sort of outsider pretending to fit in. And I just can’t cope with things in the way other people do.\n",
      "\n",
      "And this is just the mental aspect. Physically I am also broken; I have progressive peripheral neuropathy, I’m constantly tired, I can’t walk for long distances, stand for long periods of time or do any sort of prolonged physical activity without pain or discomfort and I have scars and asymmetries and muscular imbalances that will always stop me from feeling comfortable within my own skin.\n",
      "\n",
      "And yes, I haven’t tried everything. But I’ve tried a lot of things, and it’s impossible to ever ‘try everything’. Maybe I could find some medication that helps for a bit, or find a therapist who helps for a bit, or get a job that I can manage to hold, but at the end of the day I will still be me and no amount of anything can truly change who I am and how I feel about myself. I can change everything around me but I can’t change who I am. I know myself better than anyone and I can tell you now that I genuinely believe that I will never be okay and I will never shake this feeling of dysphoria, and all I want is to just be able to give up and for that to be okay because I just can’t take any more pain. I don’t want to go through more years of false hope just to end up at the same place I’ve ended up so many times in my life.\n",

How do they already have so much more figured out. So much as talking to someone in the hall fills me with dread. Each semester starts the same, I’m so excited to meet new people; to finally get rid of being alone, except I can’t leave my bed I’m so overcome with the fear of humiliating myself. Since coming to college I’ve met people who eventually ghost me and end up just adding to the long list of snapchat stories I watch that only make me sink further into my whole. I’m done here.

      "suicide - Doomed from the start.What starts as why was my life filled with all the abuse. born into this life, I was physically abused by my siblings. Not just a hit or a slap here in there, picked up and thrown, smacked hard, and verbally abuse. On top of that, i was sexually abused by my brother at a very young age. He made me suck him and try to fuck him, but i was much too young, so he got upset and told me to go back to my bed. We slept in the same room. This was before my dad find out my mom cheated on him. My dad was getting money though ss and my mom worked in different places to make ends meet although she had a nursing degree. Almost every night for over a year I would hear screaming, sometimes hitting, and the worst was when I wasn't there. She had a shotgun fired at her. It went straight through the floor where by shitty brother would have been. But I still loved him at my young age, I never understood what he had did to me back then, but I wished he died now. Quickly, throughout 1-2nd grade, I was separated from everyone. I seen everything around me crumble, with so many attributes and no one to help me thru my times while in school, I was left alone. And it stood that way. I didn't talk about my sister too much. She wasn't terrible, but she was still a piece of shit, who would peer pressure me into dress up and if I was going to tell on her, throw me, or just hurt me any way she could. My brother has completely shut out the memory of what he has done to me, same with my sister. They just don't believe it to be true. The worst part is I still have to live with my brother who is 21. I'm 17, and plan on leaving with no job, and just dying alone if I have to.\n",
      "Anyways, back on track. When my dad almost killed himself with his mental meds, he was barely saved, and my mom was able to divorce him and lock him out of the home. No-contact orders, no more guns, whatever could be done. My brother and sister both left my mom and moved in with my dad's grandma. They believed it was all her fault. She didn't know the consequences that would happen from her cheating. I stood with her, although I did it because everyone wanted to be with dad, and I didn't wanna leave mom alone. I was so young, I didn't make logical choice, but rather, out of luck, I stood with my mom. Yeah, she cheated on my dad, but she was the only reasonable parent out of the two. Encouraged school, while my dad didn't, kept us out of trouble, punished us as needed, and most of all helped me thru all of it.\n",
      "The biggest mistake however was no counseling. Like I was just fine. They thought it was just the two of then that had caused all my mental issues, but it was so much more. Mental issues already run in my family, born with a disadvantage all ready, I cranked life up to super fucking hard mode.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was 7th grade when it seems I realized the situation I was in. I still had a goal, but nothing seems achievable anymore. My grades dropped drastically, I scraped by, and still dealt with the bullying that naturally came with \"being me\" at school.\n",
      "Throughout the years I have been on meds, all seemed pointless however. No matter what brand, kind, etc. of med, it had no effect. Other then blanking me out, where I felt no emotion. I would not take meds, and I would rarely be convinced to see a counselor rather than a psych. I will go med-less. The life I am in right now is a reason to be in this terrible mental state, and I won't block it out with meds.\n",
      " I can't remember all the times, but there was brief periods of times when I lived with my dad again, it always ended in arguments, violence and then I left. The third time however, was still very recent. 15 years old or right around there, we got to fighting again. (Our house had burnt down ((while I was with dad)) and I had lost EVERYTHING. I saved my animals and nothing else. We lived with my dads friend who was still close by our neighborhood.) I fought back this time. Being head butted while I was on the ground, stunning me, and taunting me, \"ya, that hurt, didn't it?\"\n",
      "After getting back up, he forced me into the house, where I fought to leave, I hit him over and over again to leave, and finally, the cock hungry whore we were living with finally decided to call my mother. I got out.\n",

      "In high school, I was bullied still, money stolen from me, and over all ignored.\n",
      "With my dad, violence if I lived with him, verbal abuse when I didn't. The worst part of that is he thinks he can give me advice through his experiences in life when he can't even follow what he says to me.\n",
      "With my brother, he bums of my mom and takes advange of her gullablness so he can live here longer, until just a couple months ago had a girl move in against my moms say, and they would fight and hit each other a lot as well. She called the cops, got arrested for hitting him, they both laughed it off and my brother drives 50 mins away to see and stay there every day despite a no contact order.\n",
      "With my sister, we mostly  don't talk to each other. She wants to live her own life and break free from here, I can't blame her, but she doesn't deserve a second chance, at least not with me. Hell, none of them do except my mom.\n",
      "With my mom, not much really. She expects a lot more outta me because I was raised a lot better by here then my brother and sister. But the irony there is I couldn't finish high school, not because I'm dumb, but because I couldn't bring myself to go to another place of torment.\n",

      "The first class was today. I join the zoom and see that there are only 4 other students in the class. I don't remember their names so I'll try to describe them.

      "About 15 minutes into the call the teacher says to tan boy ''do you want to take your 5 minutes?''. She explains to me that tan boy really really likes trains so they give tan boy 5 minutes to talk about trains since he doesn't like to talk about anything else. I underestimated how much tan boy likes trains bc he starts streaming himself playing a train game while talking about trains and playing train sounds. We all listen for 5 minutes until the teacher says that his time has passed. he stays for 15 more minutes in the call silently then leaves. The only time he talked was about the trains during his 5 minutes. When he leaves girl with a bob explains to me that they had to limit his train talk to 5 minutes bc before they did he would go on and on about trains for the full hour and no one else could talk about anything else. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then the teacher asks African American boy if he wants to play a song for us today, he says yes. He's already at his keyboard and he plays an upbeat discoy song. He had changed some of the keys on his keyboard to play little catchphrases instead of notes so it sounded like a DJ. \n",

Then she says that she's gay and asks me if I am. I say thank you but I'm straight. Weirdly this isn't the first time a girl has hit on me and asked me if I was gay lol.

'Drop everything, and do this for me.' Recently I agreed to help someone out, driving them somewhere. Scheduled my whole week around it. Application deadlines and other commitments in account - all scheduled out.

I set the bar high, but at that point I felt ok. Not happy, but ok. Confident in my abilities and prospects. I said that the advanced degree would be a way back to the original intent, plan, whatever. I later set the post degree expectation low, any job that is justifyably degree related. I adjusted my degree expectations mid-way as shit started going wrong. I underperformed to my initial goals, but accepted that a range of personal life events and an injury made it harder.

As I said before, I don't care about the money - but some people desperately need it (again, I realise I am privileged in that sense) and this is becoming a tangent.

I don't care where it is (I mean, I do have a preference on where but not one that I am trying to enforce. If that makes sense), or what. As long as it specifically degree-related, however spuriously (I think that's reasonable, but maybe it's not. I might add that the common response to telling someone my discipline is surprise that I haven't found anything. It is supposed to be an employable area - albeit not a profitable one). Moving back into a retail/sales type position is the worst possible scenario in my head. I get it, it's important and I value and appreciate those who do it. But I cannot anymore. Stand there and smile, promising to look into an issue that a blind rat (I love rats actually) could see is one they caused themselves.

I enrolled at a community college and lived at home for 3 years. It was absolute hell. I hate the city I lived in, I felt trapped in my parents house, I hated my life for a solid 3 incredibly lonely years. This last august I finally did it. I accomplished my goal and I made it to a real university. I finally have my own space, I've made a few friends for the first time, and I even got a tiny bit attention from girls, which is completely foreign concept to me. First semester I didn't realize how hard it would be to adjust to this new life and I failed a class and got myself put on academic probation. Now I'm certain that I did not meet the minimum GPA requirement and I will now be dismissed at the end of the semester. My only saving grace is to retake classes in the summer, but I've now lost my financial aid and I won't be able to pay for them. I will also be losing my apartment, which has become my home. I love my apartment. My world is falling apart and I'm going to lose everything I worked so hard for. The thought of packing this all up and moving back home is making me feel suicidal. I've been awake  for several days and I've only eaten a couple of times this week. I feel sick all the time and I have no appetite. I'm trying so desperately to pass my finals. I'm so angry at what I've done to myself. I suffered so much to get here and now I just pissed it all away like it was nothing. I finally made some actual, real, human contact with other people and have a little bit of a social life for the first time, and I going to lose it all. Everything I have in the world is going to be taken away from me and it's my fault. I'm just a fucking stupid social retard and a habitual failure, I'm a fuck up just like everyone told me from childhood. I don't want to live anymore, I just want to die if I can't have this anymore. I hate myself, and I can't go back to my personal hell again. I can't face this and I truly don't want to wake up anymore. My life has been so lonely and terrible and this short time at my school has been the best of my life. I know how bad killing yourself hurts the people around you, but I just feel so defeated.

You can't even openly talk to most people about suicide, it's something you have to carry with you, and for those who do try to talk will mostly not understand what it is like for you. There are plenty of us out there who have had depression for years, who have thought about suicide everyday, who have thought things through carefully and know that it is what we really want, but due to pressure from friends, family, and our society, we can't kill ourselves.

At this point she had fallen asleep. I don't think I was even aware that she had fallen asleep until she 'woke up', but again I don't know, I guess I never do.

I opened my eyes and she wasn't, she was turned around, facing the other way presumably asleep. Now I don't understand why I felt that, was it a dream? I really don't know, but then I had a thought that maybe I was fucking her whilst she was sleeping. This thought ripped me apart and I know that it seems unlikely but my brain really wants me to believe it. And I guess sometimes I do. I feel horrible. I told my girlfriend about this too, and she said that it didn't happen. She said that she would have woken up and it just all sounds like a complete long shot. She said that even if it did happen, she isn't hurt and she doesn't care whatsoever. My brain can't accept this. The fact that I don't know what truly happened is killing me, so I am just assuming the worst and my brain keeps adding more complexities to the situation that further criminalise me.

Don’t try to save me or tell me it’ll be worth it, I’m an asshole, I’m a sociopath and a narcissist and I’ve messed up my relationship with the only person I cared about in the world. 20, female, rich family, college, but I don’t give a fuck that my parents gave me everything, I don’t care about anyone and always find something to hate about in everyone. I’m the devil him(her)self, feel no sympathy towards me, saying all of this is such a huge ego boost, but I’m a monster so don’t feel sympathy for me. I hurt people, string them along to drain their energy, waste their time, scar them emotionally and I can’t feel remorse. My only concern is taking and I can’t see anyone else’s point of view. Manipulating them into staying with me because I need their energy. I have no energy. Sit, watch, manipulate. That’s my personality. I have no remorse, empathy or regret—the only regret I feel is getting caught or wasting my time.  I am not a good person, and mask it like a master. Jesus on my necklace everyday. Everyday typical college girl. But no one knows who I reallly am, just the illusion that is prortrayed and now that the one person that I’ve ever experienced deep love, care, and feelings with, my favorite person, found out my truth, I can’t live with the pain of that loss. Nobody gives a fuck about me and I’m very ANGRY at the world, nobody helped me, no friends or family, no one.

I just found out I failed one of my IB classes, which is the first time I’ve ever failed a class. And right before college applications need to be sent out makes it all the worse. I just try so hard in that class and I still get the lowest grade amongst my peers. It sucks. The teacher gives me suggestions on how to improve and I try them but they never work.

      "suicide - I feel like I've failed and I don't know who to talk to anymore.My life has been out of control. I've been struggling with depression for the last 5-6 years. Ever since my sister was kicked out of the house, and then I was too a year later. I had to move in with my dad all the way across the country away from everything I had ever known where my step-mother and step-sisters were emotionally abusive. At one point, my laundry was thrown on the lawn and as I went to go pick it up, the door was slammed and locked in my face with one of them saying \"I was here first.\" I ended up breaking a window and slicing my hand up as I banged on it to try and get someone's attention to let me back inside. My dad finally moved us out my senior year. Then I went off to college in another state to try and get away from that small town and just that state in general. I went to college with almost no financial support other than what the school was able to give me. I tried going to school counselors several times but they scared me, made me feel judged, and one of them basically told me he was surprised I wasn't suicidal with everything I had told him. But I didn't tell him I mildly was. I ended up in the hospital in a terrifying event and it was like after that I just didn't want to try anymore. Everything spun downward. I couldn't get myself out of bed. I slept a lot because whenever I felt bad I would just fall asleep. It kind of made it all go away for a second. Last semester it was constant nightmares. Every night, and unrelenting. And I still have them. One time, they started before I was even asleep. Every time I closed by eyes I felt scared and so I just didn't sleep and would stay awake all night long and then eventually fall asleep in the day time from complete exhaustion. Over break I saw my family which I thought would really be nice and it just turned awful. Every argument I would have with my sister would send me into this trance state that I couldn't get out of. I felt like I've been able to fake happy for a long time to satisfy people. But it was like I couldn't fake it anymore. And this trance. It was me contemplating death and I didn't like it. It scared me. It was thoughts of how it could happen accidentally. How it could happen with minimal impact on the few people that might actually care. And now, I'm about to be kicked out of my house because I got behind on my rent. I just feel like I'm tired of trying to fight. It's like I don't have anything left.\n",

The chemical reactions within our brain that drive us to procreate, a beautiful scientific miracle. Is it really that important or do we just need to evolve, mentally, and get past this unnecessary burden. Then there comes the issue of trust. When you’re ready to commit, why should you? What gives you the right to think that this person will not turn around and fail to reciprocate the feelings you once shared? Bring me to my knees and force me to beg to forces unknown. Drowning in sorrow, not able to escape the pain, I look for a way out. As the walls slowly close in on me I begin to see and fully understand the meaning of grief.

I feel that my husband’s opinion on going the next morning suddenly changed (he was miserable the last time I was hospitalized) and wanted to look at alternatives. I named a few, but reminded him that I could be dropped as a patient for cancelling after 24 hours and (if I wasn’t dropped), my next appointment wouldn’t be till April.

He pushed for the termination with really mean wording; saying things like your child deserves better than having you as a mother.

      "suicide - I just can't live anymoreI am still young, 21M, I am succesful with my music but I got BPD and I can't bear living anymore.. My older friends always say something like \"don't be sad, some dudes will never have the same sexual experience you have, don't be sad over someone\".. but they don't get it. I've never had problem with women but right now I am completely alone and it's killing me. I am killing my pain with Oxycodone and Codeine. I wish I just fell asleep and overdosed.. I live by myself from 16yo because my parents couldn't take care of me and my whole family hates them for it. I still got 2 cats.. I was okay alone after some time but it has been like half a year. Yes, I got some hookups but I'm not that type of a guy. Few days ago, the girl I had sex with the last time (3 months ago) was here with me for a few hours and I felt nice with her company. It's just.. I think I'll not find anyone. It's killing me. I am listening to JuiceWRLD everyday because the music helps me and he was basically like me. I found a perfume of my ex who mentally abused me for year and a half. I helped her recover and was here at her worst times and it's the other way now.. I am fucked. I don't even think about her anymore, she's a terrible person but she destroyed a part of me.\n",

I honestly just feel like throwing up and crying but I can't do either. I've lost everything and I don't know what to do. I've been depressed for 11 years. in all that time I've never made a friend to talk to about it, or had anybody to support me. this past year I finally made a friend who I talked to every single day and we helped each other. she hasn't initiated a conversation with me in nearly a month now. Another support friend won't talk to me either. I don't know why. we helped each other, I thought. I tried so hard to be perfect for them. I became an object to be used to help them, specifically so they wouldn't feel like they had to leave me on the occasions that I needed them, and they did anyway. my education is shit, my family is struggling, my casual friends barely exist, my mind barely works anymore, and I just spent a whole Christmas, birthday, and new years asleep because I couldn't handle being awake. I actually called a hotline for the first time in my birthday. having someone to listen to me made me feel something, even if all they gave were the standard canned responses. I want to die so badly. I know that none of you give a shit. I know you're just here to see if anyone has been through the same stuff as you. I know I'll get nothing from this. I don't know what I'm writing anymore I'm sorry. I'm going to keep going though because coming up with these words is the only thing keeping me from going insane until the sleeping pills kick in and I can go back to sleep. I'm planning on talking to one of the friends tomorrow. I'm going to ask why they let me believe that I was important to them. I don't know why they would do that to me. I really don't ask for much.

      "suicide - Can't do it anymore...I just want to be left alone... I left the Army a few months ago, and attempted / thought seriously about suicide on multiple occasions when I was in. I was always told to \"man up\" and whatnot. So I bottled it all up for 6 years. Now I'm in the national guard. I signed that contract to avoid  reactivation and redeployment, but my armory is 300 miles away, and it costs me 100 bucks to get there and drill (after I get paid. Yes, I'm being forced to pay 100 bucks a month or go to jail). My grandpa is dying, and the place my grandma is buried is going up for sale because we can't afford his treatment, I'm struggling with bills, and to top it off, my car's gas pedal is sticking, and the car doesn't even want to start. The thought of putting my uniform on throws me into depression and I feel like shit most of the time because I'm always thinking about having to go back there. My car being broken has pushed me over the edge, because if I miss drill this month, I might go to jail. I'm sick and tired of being threatened. I'm tired of feeling helpless and useless. I work my ass off and can't give my family anything nice to show for it. I just don't know what to do right now, and can't even get my thoughts together on this page. My daughter is the only thing keeping me from blowing my brains out, and with this new threat of imprisonment, I'm feeling that I should just do it and get it over with already. The army won't give a damn about my problem. My wife isn't helping. She won't even get a job. Nobody gives a damn, and I just can't do it anymore.

I'll always be depressed, I'll always have no energy, I'll always want to kill myself every single day.

There's no help for someone like me, I'll never get better, society prefers me to be like this. It prefers that I lay in bed forever and never go outside and speak to anyone and ruin people's days because that's all I would do. No one I ask wants to help me. Something as simple as giving me a ride to a doctor is always, not only turned down but me being screamed at and told that I'm making everything up and that I'm a loser. I fucking know I'm a loser! That's why I want to kill myself! Because I'm a fucking dumb loser who will never get better! I don't have insurance, I can't drive a car, I can't even brush my hair more than once a month. I'm just a fucking child in an adult body that can't do anything ever. The most I can do is function at like an 11 year old level once a week. God I really want to fucking die. I know I'll never get better so why can't I fucking kill myself already. I don't get how I can't be fucking too afraid of the pain when it's my only option left. How is the pain that I feel every day not worse than the little bit of pain I could be in if I shot myself. It's not worse, I've been in this fucking pain for years, of much rather shoot myself. If only I had a gun. Please God give me a gun. I just want to end this.\n",

      "In case none of you have known about this, before 2014 you could play online with people from around the world on some games for the Nintendo Wii and Nintendo DS Systems. Then, they decided to shut it all down on May 20, 2014. That was the last day you could play online with anyone in any Nintendo game that had online features. Here is an article from before this date in 2014 [https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/02/the-day-the-mario-kart-died-nintendos-killswitch-and-the-future-of-online-consoles/](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/02/the-day-the-mario-kart-died-nintendos-killswitch-and-the-future-of-online-consoles/).  This terrible event effected 2 of Nintendo's most popular racing videogames: Mario Kart Wii and Mario Kart DS. And, if I'm not mistaken, you probably still own the at least one of these consoles (if not, you're missing out on even the offline games), along with a game that used this online capability feature in the before time. I, for one, loved playing with people on the internet. If you're not familiar with how Mario Kart Wii Online worked, you voted for maps, then you played a Gran Prix. Same with the DS version. I think, I'm not sure, but I think you could actually play with someone on a DS from a Wii. So, it would be deeply appreciated if you could sign up. Thank you for reading this, and have a great day!\n",

For some time I have been thinking about no matter my effort to aproach the same people as those who went to the party I am eventually left out, they say they care for me and that I am a close person to them but I just don't feel like it is that way, for some time I have been feeling as if I can just be replaced after any given time and that there is no one person who would remember me if I was gone after a week or two.\n",

I told my parents I wouldn't call, wouldn't text, and that once I was gone, I was gone. I wanted to mean it I think because I thought I was being independent. That if I did really cut them out, that I had achieved something. But I realize now that not only was I a total douche canoe, but I was also incredibly wrong. They've done more for me then I could ever ask other humans to do. They have dedicated the last 18 years of their lives to me and making sure they did their best for me. Imagine that! Seriously, think for one second about taking that much time out of your life entirely for a different person. It's astounding to me how much they genuinely care for and love me. I wasn't always the best person, and I certainly still have a ways to go, but never have they abandoned me. Every time I've screwed up, or really been down and out, they're there.

      "suicide - I'm terrified of my own self.I've lost the man I love because of my depression. And it was mostly because our relationship had become one sided.  He was becoming unhappy trying to support me. Because I live in an environment conducive to depression: graduate school in a town where I have no friends. I only had enough strength to keep my own demons at bay. I had nothing left to give him. I failed him. And I feel like I am only a burden to the people I love.  That all I will do is drag them down with me on my slowly,  but inevitably sinking ship. I'm so tired of fighting. And tonight my brain finally found the argument that could kill me. Because I lost my sister, a long time ago, I know what it is to lose someone you love. And the only thing that kept me from ever crossing the line of thinking about suicide to actually doing it was that I didn't want to put the people who love me through that. But I realized - yes, I still miss her and I always remember her, but that pain eventually fades. You find a way to continue.  So why wouldn't it be the same for them? It would hurt at first. But with time, I would only become a memory. I'm tired of hearing that my pain is overreacting or over dramatic. They aren't in my head.  They don't know how I feel.  They don't know how hard it is to fight against yourself. I go on through months or even years feeling miserable, just to feel a brief happiness. But that happiness always ends. So what's the point? This isn't living. This could barely even be considered surviving. And I'm just not strong enough anymore. I'm quickly running out of reasons to keep going. Because \"things will get better\" and \"just change your perspective\" and \"you're just overreacting\" just doesn't work anymore. Right now I see three choices before me: end it all, quit grad school and check in to a psychological hospital because I am honestly a danger to myself, or try to find a therapist willing to do pro bono because I can't afford therapy. Right now, the first option is most persuasive. I'm ready to give up.  \n",

      "suicide - I’d rather be dead I can’t believe I’m resorting to a Reddit post to try and voice these things but I just can’t find a way to articulate it to another person face-to-face. I can’t talk to anyone about myself and try to understand what is making me this way, mainly because I’m too damn scared to do so. I Feel like I put on a facade every time I talk or even smile at someone, like nobody really knows me. I’m a ghost.\n",
      "I never sleep, I’ve been running on 4hrs of rest for the past two years, both in and out of school. On the weekends I’ll sleep until like 2pm, rinse and repeat. I never get anything done, my grades are slipping. I have a D in physics and algebra and my mother and father will never cease to keep scolding me about it, I want to fix it but always end up procrastinating and saying “I’ll just do it tomorrow”. \n",
      "I rarely ever talk to anyone anymore, my 2 closest friends are now dating each other and are always doing stuff without me, not to mention their both 5x the student I am. There are a few other people I talk too but they are never available. This is all made 10x worse by doing school from home this year.\n",
      "I have nothing to be proud of, nothing to show for myself. I haven’t even worked my first job yet or gotten my drivers license and mom + dad always tease me and nullify my arguments or requests with that fact. \n",
      "My father is nice to me most of the time but has an explosive anger that will flare up at the slightest things, like soda cans in the fridge being warm. He routinely throws adult tantrums, has not hurt anyone or broken anything though. Whenever I try to talk to him about my problems he insists it’s all my fault and I should just get off my ass and try harder, that I don’t care about my future at all, which just isn’t true. He thinks it’s funny to automatically blame me for when anything in the house goes missing or stops working, assuming I somehow broke it. I feel leagues more comfortable talking to my mom, but she’s always working and rarely free to talk to. \n",
      "I feel completely lost and have no idea where I want to take my life. Im scared that I’m running out of time to chose a direction to go in and I’ll be screwed sooner or later. This is only made worse by my mother pressuring me to chose a path NOW. \n",
      "Almost nothing makes me happy anymore, I’m always stressed and anxious now. It’s like and endless cycle that resurfaces each day. I’m regularly thinking about suicide, how it would finally make everyone understand. Make everyone feel sorry they never asked how I was doing. I have no history of hurting myself, and haven’t really gotten close to doing it at all, but I’m talking myself into it. I don’t want to do it, I really don’t, I’m scared I’ll convince myself though. \n",

      "non-suicide - I dreamt that I had a girlfriend I am typing this out as I am feeling things so the language isn't perfect. \n",
      "\n",
      "I had never actually met her, but somehow we ended up video calling each other (dream logic lol) and we had a good time and became very friendly with each other. She wasn't THE prettiest girl in the world (she was still cute), but I still thought she was really nice and when we ended the call, I couldn't help but hope that I would get to see her again at some point in time. The second time we called, we decided for it to be a date, and we then we met in real life and had a lot of fun just being friends with each other. We didn't do anything sexual nor did we even physically touch each other but we really cared for each other and kept trying to help the other person.  I never felt pressured or nervous when talking to her - even when we met up in real life for the first time. It all just felt really natural and and we just went at our own pace. What I found interesting is that my love for her had absolutely nothing to do with looks, I enjoyed being with her her mainly because of her personality, which is different from my crushes or what I thought I liked. With the crushes I have tried to get to know better, I was always nervous and never felt like I could be myself, but with her, it was like we were already great friends who could freely be themselves with each other. She made me feel relaxed just by talking to her, andI can't imagine any dispute would ever come between us because of how natural we are together and with each other. I couldn't even imagine a future without her, there just didn't seem to be a way we would ever separate from each other. I know this sounds a bit cliche, but it was like we were actually made for each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "I knew that she was someone who would always care for me and always had my back. We both had the same sense of humor and was interested in the same topics. Her name was sammie, or lawton, or lawie? ... or something, I can't remember it that well. I know she had black hair and was shorter than me, but I can't remember anything else. She was very gentle but therr was also confident, but knew how to respect other people's words but could also say what she wants to say. \n",

      "I just woke up and I feel kinda sad. I'm not heartbroken, but it is like a longing and an acceptance that I don't have nor will I ever have such love in my life -- it was just a dream.\n",

      "I hope I get to see her again because I want to ask her name one more time so I can try to remember it, or look at her face and try to memorize how her she looks. At the same time, I don't want to see her again because I don't want to fall more in love with someone in my dreams and make myself more unhappy in real life. Actually, I think I do want to see her again because I want to feel that kind of happiness and feel that valued and cared for by somebody. I really, truly felt happy and now I realize that I don't truly know what love is, because the connection with her wasn't as 'deep'  as I expect love to be, but it felt like it was love. Sorry I'm having a bit of trouble putting it into words... these are just some feelings I am trying to capture.\n",
      "\n",
      "After I woke up, I could feel my heart in my chest, and it felt like it was being squeezed, like it was looking for something that wasn't there, and it was longing for something that it felt it was missing. It sort of felt like something deep inside of it was hollow, and that was making in hurt. \n",
      "\n",
      "You know what, I think I do want to see her again. It's not like I am having love in my life or will any time soon, and things have been kinda shitty lately. I hope I don't fall too much in love with her, but I really want to feel that happiness and those emotions one more time and try to remember them better, so that way if I ever met her in *real* real life I would know that I am. Maybe it isn't so bad if I fall in love with her... as long as I keep getting to see her. \n",

      "suicide - I think I might kill myself.I've been thinking about it a lot recently. Something big and negative happened in my life recently and it's rocked my life. My only way of coping has been self harming, and more recently it hasn't been doing the job as well as it had been. I feel so alone. I don't really have anything in my life worth mentioning. I don't have a job, and anxiety and low mood prevents me even considering getting one. I don't have any friends. I don't socialise. I just stay in my house with my two dogs. I know I should be grateful for what I have, but I'm not. I cry all the time. I self harm more but even that doesn't seem to be working any more. I know how I would do it, and I know it would be successful. I live alone so no one would be able to stop me or save me. It would be quite quick. It would hurt, but not for long. I've been self harming for 13 years. I've been \"mentally ill\" for more than half of my life, and I'm really not that old. No amount of tablets, therapy, hospital treatment etc has ever helped. I am one of those lost causes people talk about. I've been told by professionals that I'm a waste of time and resources. I'm just so tired and lonely. I don't think there is another way out of this for me. I feel ready for this to end.\n",

The teacher could have saved the trouble and not say anything, but they didn't, meaning that they care for you, being scolded by teacher may not be a bad thing, it points out your mistake that was invisible to you, and the teacher wants to see you improve of it and succeed. Sure the teacher may get angry for a while, but in the end they just want the best of you. So if you're dwelling on a mistake and scolding your teacher pointed out, crush that thought and throw it away and take the teacher's advice, try again and show that you are sincere, that is the key to success. I am encouraging those who feel and down as well as myself who recently got reprimanded. Don't dwell, your teachers scold you to point your mistakes, If you don't notice your mistakes and carry them to the real world, the consequences will be much more dire.

      "suicide - The only true reason I am alive..The only reason I’m still alive is because I don’t want my debt to go to my family such as my student loans and I don’t want my choice to die to permanently affect my family forever so I stay alive and continue to suffer. Life has no meaning and I wish everyday that I was never born. I feel like life is suffering and I am bored of being here and have nothing to look forward to. Everything I try and do ends in failure and disappointment. All the beauty that people talk about in life doesn’t compare to the suffering of existing. I feel like it’s such a massive effort to do everything and to exist I won’t even say live. I hate the struggles I have that I can’t control and the numbness I feel and disinterest I have in life. The only reason I’m alive now is to work, be alone and die. I have given up on romantic relationships and friendships. I’m too depressed and tiring to be around but people don’t see how much effort I put in everyday and am told to try harder and life is a choice. I just wish I didn’t believe when people say it gets better because it doesn’t and hasn’t and just don’t see the point of continuing to stay alive. Everyday I envy those that dead from covid or sick in the hospital from covid and then I see that suicide might not work and I wish that assisted suicide was a thing. The other night I had a dream that I was shot and that was the most peace I had ever felt but then I woke up and everything started again. I just have zero desire to stay here. I don’t even want things to get better, I don’t want to be happy, I feel numb and just want to die.\n",

Yes, it’s not a good look to have done that, and I’m sure they could have handled it better. But by the LITERAL RULES OF REDDIT that post had to have been removed, and like it or not that happened. There can still be other means to catch the truly evil person and others like him, but if the subreddit was taken down, all of this, this whole community would be gone for good. We still can make an effort to clean the community, and rid of the truly evil people who do things like what happened to the 14 year old girl. However, when we call the mods themself evil people, and say they are on the predators side, you just realize they are humans too (teenagers at that), and no human is perfect. They are doing their job, and in my opinion, a pretty good one, besides what imperfections there may be. I am conscious this post likely will be downvoted to oblivion, but I hate the predators just as much as the next guy. I just think when you shit on the mods, and talk about them being evil or deranged, there is a human on the other side, who is receiving and taking whatever you have to say. You don’t see then banning people who speak out against them, you see them politely responding a majority of the time, and I think that’s something to be respected.

      "non-suicide - Father of Philosophy on the Übermensch- Double Axe Murder Mystery (Books to Video) With the hottest takes on criminology, Fyodor Dostoyevsky reconsiders the questions our culture is predicated on in Crime and Punishment. A young man Razkolnikov has been beaten down by life with a starving mother and a sister about to whore herself to a man who doesn't love her. After intensely portrayed months of contemplating his own rectitude the boy calculates the benefit to the community of killing the town pawn broker. This would free her captive niece, relieve the town of their debt and save his mother and sister. After the plan is carried out all hell breaks loose and Razkolnikov is left with the intense guilt of murder which continues to plague his conventional morality. One of the top must reads of the past 150 years portrays a young mans development into adulthood by taking the law into his own hands with Fyodor's iconic interpretation of criminology.\n",

      "non-suicide - A kid had a gun in his backpack So it was lunch time, and the teachers were talking about covid and all that stuff but before that a kid dropped some of his food. So after that he threw all of his food on the ground. He later went to go get more food. So while all this was happening this kid finally sat back down and one of the teachers said  \"Who ever threw all this food onto the floor needs to stop acting like a child.\" The kid got so mad and he started digging through his backpack. The whole time the teachers were talking his hands were shaking as if he was trying to decide whether or not to use the gun. Meanwhile I was sitting on the stage and watching him. One of my friends had told me it was a pellet gun or an airsoft but the gun didn't look like a fake. After the teachers were don't talking he took the \"gun\" and put it into his lunch box only to put it back in his backpack. I don't really know whether or not it was a real gun or not and I don't understand why the kids with anger issues are just allowed to do what they want. The teachers didn't do nothing.

She has been very supportive of me and likewise I have tried my best though she is incredibly smart and I doubt she will struggle at all. In addition to this she is pretty. A month or so ago it was London fashion week and she was scouted by a modelling agency. At this point things are looking good. Despite what I can only assume what must have been a huge boost to her self esteem, she is still very down to earth. I doubt she will take it as a career path, she is too smart to become just some skinny model walking up and down all day.\n",

I haven't done much drinking hence I didn't really know what to do but I tried to clean her up and about an hour or so later I fell asleep on the floor next to her and our friend and her boyfriend. Sort of in a big heap on the floor. If you picture it as four sticks in a row.

Even as she was turning I had realised my mistake. The girl I had grabbed was not my girlfriend. We make eye contact and she slowly whispers \"what the fuck was that?\". I'm lost for words fumbling in the dark. She loses it starts hitting me and wakes up her boyfriend. He's generally a chill dude but she's making out that I practically raped her. All I have are fumbled excuses. My girlfriend wakes up to our friends screams. Her parents come in. I basically just zone out to everyone shouting at me.\n",

      "suicide - I've finally given in.I have struggled with mental health since I was about 13 years old and repressed memories of abuse from my brother came to light. I talked to my mom about the abuse and she told my dad and they...did nothing. They each spoke to me about it once and pretty much just said \"that's sucks that it happened.\" I have slowly deteriorated into the most useless person on earth since then. I had a decent time in high school because I had some things going for me, but once I got to college everything snowballed. I went from being on the dean's list to failing most classes and barely passing others. I changed from a major I was passionate about because I couldn't handle the social pressure involved which wasn't even that much pressure. I'm just no good at talking to people and making friends. I eventually dropped out because if I didn't I was going to flunk out. Now my long-term boyfriend does everything to take care of me. I've never had a job and I have a violent, aggressive panic attack when I even start to look for part time work. I can't cook, I rarely leave the house, and now even my coping mechanisms - both healthy and not - don't make a single impact on my stupid, useless brain. I've fought against this for so long, but last week, while I had some friends over, I was in the bathroom feeling ok. Which is way better than I usually feel. But then I got that familiar rush of sad numbness again. And I just knew. I realized right then that this will be the end of me. My death will be from suicide. I do not know when but I do know it's inevitable. I've tried to get help in the past but it's just so hopeless. I feel better in the moment talking to counselors but as soon as I get home I just dismiss it and go back to my pathetic, useless existence. It's like I want to stay like this. Or at least my brain does. I was put on antidepressants for awhile and was very hopeful that would help me but instead it made me hate myself more. I always felt like a phony. Like I was only feeling \"better\" because of this facade the pills put up. I couldn't even stand to look at myself.. So I weaned off of them and felt quite a bit better for some time. I was glad to be my genuine self again. But then I remembered that my genuine self is a useless piece of shit who bums out and burdens everyone around me. So now I'm just waiting. I know the day is getting closer but I still have no clue when it'll take me. But no matter when it is it'll be too late. I've already caused everyone around me so much grief and wasted so much of their time that they'll never get back...\n",

      "suicide - I'm supposed to be \"objectively\" happy, but I'm not and I just need something. To explain a little of my backstory, I'll try and give as much details about my life without being too specific. I used to go to a really good high school that you had to test to get in to. I was projected to do very well and a lot of people, i.e. friends and family thought i would succeed and use this high school as a launching point. I crumbled under the pressure, and i felt so insecure about my place in life that all i could do was basically sit at home and play league and contemplate the meaning of self-harm. I eventually transferred out of that high school and into another one where i skimped by. I had many many many therapy sessions before i graduated high school, a majority of them focused on the societal and familial pressures that i felt were placed on me because i was not living up to the expectations that they nor I had. I graduated high school with a sub par gpa and eventually went to a college, following another one of my closest friends. My first year of college consisted of one of my first friends committing suicide, this hurt me so deep because it really altered what i had personally preconceived people with depression as. See, this particular friend was always the highlight of the group, the leader, the percy jackson main character that seemed to have everyone else follow. I was in and out of college at that point, withdrawing and dropping out basically. I eventually moved away and then got a job. I had many more therapy sessions, dealing with my deeper psychological problems ranging from self-hatred to a constant need for approval from others. I eventually stopped counseling, i had thought i got better. I started dating a girl i had met online. I decided to go back to school, because I have support systems, a drive to finish college, to provide for myself and my future significant other. However, I'm not happy. I'm not happy right now, regardless of how well I'm doing in college, how good my relationship is going, my family's health are all standard. I'm simply not happy, and i've been disassociating to the point where sometimes i can see myself from a third point of view and I don't know how to explain it to the people around me, to the girlfriend that loves and supports me. I can honestly say that for the first time in a while, I want to die, for no particular reason. I simply wish to... cease existence. But i know i can't just do that. I know how much it would hurt the people i care about. But i don't know how to stop this downward spiral that is slowly eating away at my psyche like a worm inside of an apple. Please help me, I beg you.\n",

      "suicide - i have no idea what to doi turned 18 in july. i recently found out i might have autism (and i think it explains a lot), but it was never diagnosed. someone i used to love posted things a few months ago, basically saying i was toxic and a horrible person and they wish they could hurt me back. this really fucked me up, because i didnt know i was hurting her or that i was saying anything wrong. i was really suicidal, but got advice that motivated me to forget about her, not give up, find a purpose in life (i still have the screenshot as my phone wallpaper.) this helped, and from then until a few weeks ago, i tried really hard to fight against depression. however, things got bad again when i tried to apply for a job. i freaked out ended up not going to the interview. things went downhill and i stopped leaving the house ever, or trying to cook or keep interested in anything. all i do is play video games, but i can feel myself losing interest in them too, i sit around just thinking when not playing. i know im a failure and a huge disappointment. i cant go to the community college i was planning on trying because that person goes there, and seeing her terrifies me. i know things are going bad, so i asked my mom to get a psychiatry appointment, but i heard her and my dad talking about the copay, my dad saying how its not their responsibility anymore to pay for it, but theyll help this time. this really freaks me out. i really need to get tested for autism. im also trans, and just knowing how extremely far away and expensive hormones are hurts so much. i need to get a job, but its terrifying, and there are ao few options, as my social skills are absolutely awful. i dont see how i can possibly do anything or support myself in life with my depression, anxiety, possible autism, and inability to talk to people right. i feel awful mooching off my parents. i dont want them to have to pay for me to got to the mental hospital for a 4th time, so i havent told them how bad im doing. the best option is suicide, which ive researched and have a plan i believe will work. the only thing stopping me is a thought i had. my parents raised me, sent me to therapists and hospitals and such. i feel like itd be really inconsiderate to kill myself after theyve put so much money into me. would it make that a waste? would they think raising me was a waste and regret it? normally i have the mentality that when im dead, ill be gone so it doesnt matter if people are sad or anything(i rarely care about people's feelings right anyways).\n",

I already have bad dental issues I’m trying to take care of and my appointment is before my birthday. That’s already gonna cost me so much money, and now with the asshole issues I’m just spiraling. I got a new server job that I don’t even want and haven’t really started yet because I’ve been sick and am getting a Covid test. I don’t think it’s Covid, but you can’t be too safe these days in 2020. I’m so tired of struggling. I’ve had to sacrifice my mental health for other more important priorities like making sure I can eat once a day is my eating disorder will allow me. I’m pretty sure my nana doesn’t have much time left either and know that’ll be coming soon enough. I don’t have any family besides my mom and her. My mom has her own sad story snd can’t even help me besides emotional support, and I feel so damn guilty over that already. What’s the point in anything anymore? Any light that has been in my life felt as if its all been ripped away from me. I feel another attempt again, and it’s been 4 years since I’ve failed last time. I know I’d rather go through with succeeding to kill myself than to ever go back to any psych ward. I’ve wanted to attempt to kill myself the entire 3 weeks I was in there and quickly go out due to faking being better.

      "suicide - Hello, goodbye.The crushing loneliness that fills my heart whenever I lay down to sleep is immensely irritating. I find myself merely wanting the physical presence of another human to mitigate my sorrow, however I cannot imagine that any sane human being would even want to be near me. In my own eyes I'm worthless and the whole world would be better off without me in it. People have tried to change my mind, family, friends, therapists, psychiatrists, psychologists. All of them have failed because my self deprecation has reached astounding levels. Only matched by my apathy for any given situation. I go over silly little scenarios in my head where I meet someone and we fall in love and for that brief moment of delusion I'm happy but then reality sets in and my false happiness is shattered. So I've learned to fake my emotions, I've gotten pretty good at it. You could ask anyone who knows me and they would assure you that I'm the happiest person they've met. My mask has become near flawless. I have long since outgrown my fear of death. The real thing keeping me alive is my own aforementioned apathy. I've talked to strangers about suicide. They see it as selfish and cruel and can't see why I would want to do that to my loved ones. I however see those very same loved ones as the cruel ones. They want me to continue to suffer simply so they don't have to be sad about my death? Wasn't this life given to me? Can I not choose when and how to end it? I never asked to be born. I never wanted this life. I just want to sleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "The more I think about it the more I realize that this life is completely pointless. Why chase happiness when I can just die and not worry about it? People are always searching for their reasons to continue living but I'm one of the few who have just simply stopped looking. I realized some time ago that everything that society teaches us is in the end goal of passing on our genetic code. We go to school to get an education. So we can get good paying jobs. So that we can show to the opposite sex that we're a worthy mate. I couldn't care less about if I had children or not. My family name will most likely die with me. I wouldn't be a very good parent anyhow. I have too much anger, too much hate, too much darkness. Any offspring I would create would be even more psychologically damaged than I am. The only thing I truly want is my own death. There is no doubt in my mind that I will die by my own hands. I've already seen myself die hundreds of times in my dreams, and each time I wake up not short of breath and covered in sweat but calm and smiling because my own death comforts me. Knowing that I'll be dead soon and that the loneliness and anger will no longer consume my entire being is such an amazing thought. I have only ever self harmed once in my entire life. Part of me regrets it, not because of the scars or looks I get when people see them, but because I see self harm as a crutch. I understand a lot of people do it and it makes them feel like their in control of at least something. Among other reasons. I however would rather harm myself to the point of my life ending. The fact that I didn't, in my mind, makes me weak. I also regret it because now that I have drawn my own blood, I have this constant need to do it again. Blood and I have a very loving relationship. To me blood is intoxicating. The smell, the sight, the sound, the touch and the taste. I love them all. When I see my blood I have to fight this dark urge to not tear my body apart in order to see more.\n",
