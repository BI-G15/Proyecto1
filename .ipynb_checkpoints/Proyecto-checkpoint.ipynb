I feel that my husband’s opinion on going the next morning suddenly changed (he was miserable the last time I was hospitalized) and wanted to look at alternatives. I named a few, but reminded him that I could be dropped as a patient for cancelling after 24 hours and (if I wasn’t dropped), my next appointment wouldn’t be till April.

So I've been reaching out and ultimately presented to the emergency department with suicidal thoughts two days ago after trying to crash my car and stab myself over a couple weeks. They sent me home with a referral to a psychiatrist at the community mental health centre. I was told it would be for a medication review, but about 10 minutes in it was clear he was fixated on my pregnancy and he spent 20 minutes or so insisting the best thing would be to terminate. He pushed for the termination with really mean wording; saying things like your child deserves better than having you as a mother. In the last 5 minutes or so he said if I was determined to try being a parent there might be support for that, but didn't elaborate on it and said even with it I'd just be hoping to one day reach \"good enough\". I was already filled with so much doubt, guilt and self-loathing that I wanted to die...

      "suicide - Can't do it anymore...I just want to be left alone... I left the Army a few months ago, and attempted / thought seriously about suicide on multiple occasions when I was in. I was always told to \"man up\" and whatnot. So I bottled it all up for 6 years. Now I'm in the national guard. I signed that contract to avoid  reactivation and redeployment, but my armory is 300 miles away, and it costs me 100 bucks to get there and drill (after I get paid. Yes, I'm being forced to pay 100 bucks a month or go to jail). My grandpa is dying, and the place my grandma is buried is going up for sale because we can't afford his treatment, I'm struggling with bills, and to top it off, my car's gas pedal is sticking, and the car doesn't even want to start. The thought of putting my uniform on throws me into depression and I feel like shit most of the time because I'm always thinking about having to go back there. My car being broken has pushed me over the edge, because if I miss drill this month, I might go to jail. I'm sick and tired of being threatened. I'm tired of feeling helpless and useless. I work my ass off and can't give my family anything nice to show for it. I just don't know what to do right now, and can't even get my thoughts together on this page. My daughter is the only thing keeping me from blowing my brains out, and with this new threat of imprisonment, I'm feeling that I should just do it and get it over with already. The army won't give a damn about my problem. My wife isn't helping. She won't even get a job. Nobody gives a damn, and I just can't do it anymore. I want out, and I'd rather do it on my own terms than someone else's....\n",

I know that isn't going to help anything but makes me feel better because I deserve that pain and the constant reminder, I deserve to die but here i am, a depressed mess that can't even end her own life no matter how hard she tries.

      "suicide - I spent today trying to get better, I hung out with my dad, I exercised, I showered, I ate a salad.And guess what? I feel just as bad as I did last night. It's almost like depression doesn't care if I fucking shower or eat a salad. There really isn't any way for me to get better. I'll always be depressed, I'll always have no energy, I'll always want to kill myself every single day. I can bash my head against a wall all I want but I'll never actually feel good about myself or anything. I'll never feel like an adult. I just want to see a fucking doctor, I want to not feel like this. I want to work to get better but I can't fucking do it on my own. I push myself to my very fucking limit of trying to fix myself and I always end up feeling even worse. I want to hang myself so bad, the only thing stopping me is that I don't have a rope. I want to see a gender therapist and get on T and get a job and go back to college but all these things I want to do I can't do on my own I try and try and I can't do anything ever. Everyone says just take baby steps and I've been struggling with taking the step of brushing my teeth every day for over two years now and I can't even take that step. There's no help for someone like me, I'll never get better, society prefers me to be like this. It prefers that I lay in bed forever and never go outside and speak to anyone and ruin people's days because that's all I would do. No one I ask wants to help me. Something as simple as giving me a ride to a doctor is always, not only turned down but me being screamed at and told that I'm making everything up and that I'm a loser. I fucking know I'm a loser! That's why I want to kill myself! Because I'm a fucking dumb loser who will never get better! I don't have insurance, I can't drive a car, I can't even brush my hair more than once a month. I'm just a fucking child in an adult body that can't do anything ever. The most I can do is function at like an 11 year old level once a week. God I really want to fucking die. I know I'll never get better so why can't I fucking kill myself already. I don't get how I can't be fucking too afraid of the pain when it's my only option left. How is the pain that I feel every day not worse than the little bit of pain I could be in if I shot myself. It's not worse, I've been in this fucking pain for years, of much rather shoot myself. If only I had a gun. Please God give me a gun. I just want to end this.\n",

      "In case none of you have known about this, before 2014 you could play online with people from around the world on some games for the Nintendo Wii and Nintendo DS Systems. Then, they decided to shut it all down on May 20, 2014. That was the last day you could play online with anyone in any Nintendo game that had online features. Here is an article from before this date in 2014 [https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/02/the-day-the-mario-kart-died-nintendos-killswitch-and-the-future-of-online-consoles/](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/02/the-day-the-mario-kart-died-nintendos-killswitch-and-the-future-of-online-consoles/).  This terrible event effected 2 of Nintendo's most popular racing videogames: Mario Kart Wii and Mario Kart DS. And, if I'm not mistaken, you probably still own the at least one of these consoles (if not, you're missing out on even the offline games), along with a game that used this online capability feature in the before time. I, for one, loved playing with people on the internet. If you're not familiar with how Mario Kart Wii Online worked, you voted for maps, then you played a Gran Prix. Same with the DS version. I think, I'm not sure, but I think you could actually play with someone on a DS from a Wii. So, it would be deeply appreciated if you could sign up. Thank you for reading this, and have a great day!\n",
      "suicide - I don't understand if I am really unreplaceable or if I do matter to othersI just got back from the birthday party of a girl I've had a close relationship for over a year, but I feel like I'm not good enough for her. I was with her at first but as more people arrived eventually she talked with other people, some of my friends came too but they were talking with others (there weren't more than 12 people there) so for the majority of the time I just sat there alone. For some time I have been thinking about no matter my effort to aproach the same people as those who went to the party I am eventually left out, they say they care for me and that I am a close person to them but I just don't feel like it is that way, for some time I have been feeling as if I can just be replaced after any given time and that there is no one person who would remember me if I was gone after a week or two.\n",

I told my parents I wouldn't call, wouldn't text, and that once I was gone, I was gone. I wanted to mean it I think because I thought I was being independent. That if I did really cut them out, that I had achieved something. But I realize now that not only was I a total douche canoe, but I was also incredibly wrong. They've done more for me then I could ever ask other humans to do. They have dedicated the last 18 years of their lives to me and making sure they did their best for me. Imagine that! Seriously, think for one second about taking that much time out of your life entirely for a different person. It's astounding to me how much they genuinely care for and love me. I wasn't always the best person, and I certainly still have a ways to go, but never have they abandoned me. Every time I've screwed up, or really been down and out, they're there.

      "suicide - I'm terrified of my own self.I've lost the man I love because of my depression. And it was mostly because our relationship had become one sided.  He was becoming unhappy trying to support me. Because I live in an environment conducive to depression: graduate school in a town where I have no friends. I only had enough strength to keep my own demons at bay. I had nothing left to give him. I failed him. And I feel like I am only a burden to the people I love.  That all I will do is drag them down with me on my slowly,  but inevitably sinking ship. I'm so tired of fighting. And tonight my brain finally found the argument that could kill me. Because I lost my sister, a long time ago, I know what it is to lose someone you love. And the only thing that kept me from ever crossing the line of thinking about suicide to actually doing it was that I didn't want to put the people who love me through that. But I realized - yes, I still miss her and I always remember her, but that pain eventually fades. You find a way to continue.  So why wouldn't it be the same for them? It would hurt at first. But with time, I would only become a memory. I'm tired of hearing that my pain is overreacting or over dramatic. They aren't in my head.  They don't know how I feel.  They don't know how hard it is to fight against yourself. I go on through months or even years feeling miserable, just to feel a brief happiness. But that happiness always ends. So what's the point? This isn't living. This could barely even be considered surviving. And I'm just not strong enough anymore. I'm quickly running out of reasons to keep going. Because \"things will get better\" and \"just change your perspective\" and \"you're just overreacting\" just doesn't work anymore. Right now I see three choices before me: end it all, quit grad school and check in to a psychological hospital because I am honestly a danger to myself, or try to find a therapist willing to do pro bono because I can't afford therapy. Right now, the first option is most persuasive. I'm ready to give up.  \n",

She wasn't THE prettiest girl in the world (she was still cute), but I still thought she was really nice and when we ended the call, I couldn't help but hope that I would get to see her again at some point in time. The second time we called, we decided for it to be a date, and we then we met in real life and had a lot of fun just being friends with each other. We didn't do anything sexual nor did we even physically touch each other but we really cared for each other and kept trying to help the other person.  I never felt pressured or nervous when talking to her - even when we met up in real life for the first time. It all just felt really natural and and we just went at our own pace. What I found interesting is that my love for her had absolutely nothing to do with looks, I enjoyed being with her her mainly because of her personality, which is different from my crushes or what I thought I liked. With the crushes I have tried to get to know better, I was always nervous and never felt like I could be myself, but with her, it was like we were already great friends who could freely be themselves with each other. She made me feel relaxed just by talking to her, andI can't imagine any dispute would ever come between us because of how natural we are together and with each other. I couldn't even imagine a future without her, there just didn't seem to be a way we would ever separate from each other.

Actually, I think I do want to see her again because I want to feel that kind of happiness and feel that valued and cared for by somebody. I really, truly felt happy and now I realize that I don't truly know what love is, because the connection with her wasn't as 'deep'  as I expect love to be, but it felt like it was love.

My only way of coping has been self harming, and more recently it hasn't been doing the job as well as it had been. I feel so alone. I don't really have anything in my life worth mentioning. I don't have a job, and anxiety and low mood prevents me even considering getting one. I don't have any friends. I don't socialise. I just stay in my house with my two dogs. I know I should be grateful for what I have, but I'm not. I cry all the time. I self harm more but even that doesn't seem to be working any more. I know how I would do it, and I know it would be successful. I live alone so no one would be able to stop me or save me. It would be quite quick. It would hurt, but not for long. I've been self harming for 13 years. I've been \"mentally ill\" for more than half of my life, and I'm really not that old. No amount of tablets, therapy, hospital treatment etc has ever helped. I am one of those lost causes people talk about. I've been told by professionals that I'm a waste of time and resources. I'm just so tired and lonely.

Sure the teacher may get angry for a while, but in the end they just want the best of you. So if you're dwelling on a mistake and scolding your teacher pointed out, crush that thought and throw it away and take the teacher's advice, try again and show that you are sincere, that is the key to success.

I’m too depressed and tiring to be around but people don’t see how much effort I put in everyday and am told to try harder and life is a choice. I just wish I didn’t believe when people say it gets better because it doesn’t and hasn’t and just don’t see the point of continuing to stay alive.

      "non-suicide - I’m gonna say something which has been bothering me for the past day about Ever since that post with the 14 year old girl getting banned, (I’m sure you know which one I mean) I’ve seen people shitting on the mods. Yes, it’s not a good look to have done that, and I’m sure they could have handled it better. But by the LITERAL RULES OF REDDIT that post had to have been removed, and like it or not that happened. There can still be other means to catch the truly evil person and others like him, but if the subreddit was taken down, all of this, this whole community would be gone for good. We still can make an effort to clean the community, and rid of the truly evil people who do things like what happened to the 14 year old girl. However, when we call the mods themself evil people, and say they are on the predators side, you just realize they are humans too (teenagers at that), and no human is perfect. They are doing their job, and in my opinion, a pretty good one, besides what imperfections there may be. I am conscious this post likely will be downvoted to oblivion, but I hate the predators just as much as the next guy. I just think when you shit on the mods, and talk about them being evil or deranged, there is a human on the other side, who is receiving and taking whatever you have to say. You don’t see then banning people who speak out against them, you see them politely responding a majority of the time, and I think that’s something to be respected.

      "non-suicide - Father of Philosophy on the Übermensch- Double Axe Murder Mystery (Books to Video) With the hottest takes on criminology, Fyodor Dostoyevsky reconsiders the questions our culture is predicated on in Crime and Punishment. A young man Razkolnikov has been beaten down by life with a starving mother and a sister about to whore herself to a man who doesn't love her. After intensely portrayed months of contemplating his own rectitude the boy calculates the benefit to the community of killing the town pawn broker. This would free her captive niece, relieve the town of their debt and save his mother and sister. After the plan is carried out all hell breaks loose and Razkolnikov is left with the intense guilt of murder which continues to plague his conventional morality. One of the top must reads of the past 150 years portrays a young mans development into adulthood by taking the law into his own hands with Fyodor's iconic interpretation of criminology.\n",

There are just some things I can't change. I don't want to accept that. Why did I have to fail? My outlook is so positive when I'm high. But that's illegal.

      "non-suicide - A kid had a gun in his backpack So it was lunch time, and the teachers were talking about covid and all that stuff but before that a kid dropped some of his food. So after that he threw all of his food on the ground. He later went to go get more food. So while all this was happening this kid finally sat back down and one of the teachers said  \"Who ever threw all this food onto the floor needs to stop acting like a child.\" The kid got so mad and he started digging through his backpack. The whole time the teachers were talking his hands were shaking as if he was trying to decide whether or not to use the gun. Meanwhile I was sitting on the stage and watching him. One of my friends had told me it was a pellet gun or an airsoft but the gun didn't look like a fake. After the teachers were don't talking he took the \"gun\" and put it into his lunch box only to put it back in his backpack. I don't really know whether or not it was a real gun or not and I don't understand why the kids with anger issues are just allowed to do what they want. The teachers didn't do nothing.

Past myself the only people who know are my parents and older sister. i have a younger brother aswell though he is autistic and requires constant attention from either my parents or a carer. We aren't exactly rich so paying for a full time carer is practically impossible, so between everyone in my family, including some extended family, we take care of him. \n",

She has been very supportive of me and likewise I have tried my best though she is incredibly smart and I doubt she will struggle at all. In addition to this she is pretty. A month or so ago it was London fashion week and she was scouted by a modelling agency. At this point things are looking good. Despite what I can only assume what must have been a huge boost to her self esteem, she is still very down to earth. I doubt she will take it as a career path, she is too smart to become just some skinny model walking up and down all day.\n",

      "Our mutual friend (another girl) started becoming closer to the both of us. She and her boyfriend invited me and mine to her house one night, sort of like a double date.

I haven't done much drinking hence I didn't really know what to do but I tried to clean her up and about an hour or so later I fell asleep on the floor next to her and our friend and her boyfriend. Sort of in a big heap on the floor. If you picture it as four sticks in a row.

Even as she was turning I had realised my mistake. The girl I had grabbed was not my girlfriend. We make eye contact and she slowly whispers \"what the fuck was that?\". I'm lost for words fumbling in the dark. She loses it starts hitting me and wakes up her boyfriend. He's generally a chill dude but she's making out that I practically raped her. All I have are fumbled excuses. My girlfriend wakes up to our friends screams. Her parents come in. I basically just zone out to everyone shouting at me.\n",

      "suicide - I've finally given in.I have struggled with mental health since I was about 13 years old and repressed memories of abuse from my brother came to light. I talked to my mom about the abuse and she told my dad and they...did nothing. They each spoke to me about it once and pretty much just said \"that's sucks that it happened.\" I have slowly deteriorated into the most useless person on earth since then. I had a decent time in high school because I had some things going for me, but once I got to college everything snowballed. I went from being on the dean's list to failing most classes and barely passing others. I changed from a major I was passionate about because I couldn't handle the social pressure involved which wasn't even that much pressure. I'm just no good at talking to people and making friends. I eventually dropped out because if I didn't I was going to flunk out. Now my long-term boyfriend does everything to take care of me. I've never had a job and I have a violent, aggressive panic attack when I even start to look for part time work. I can't cook, I rarely leave the house, and now even my coping mechanisms - both healthy and not - don't make a single impact on my stupid, useless brain. I've fought against this for so long, but last week, while I had some friends over, I was in the bathroom feeling ok. Which is way better than I usually feel. But then I got that familiar rush of sad numbness again. And I just knew. I realized right then that this will be the end of me. My death will be from suicide. I do not know when but I do know it's inevitable. I've tried to get help in the past but it's just so hopeless. I feel better in the moment talking to counselors but as soon as I get home I just dismiss it and go back to my pathetic, useless existence. It's like I want to stay like this. Or at least my brain does. I was put on antidepressants for awhile and was very hopeful that would help me but instead it made me hate myself more. I always felt like a phony. Like I was only feeling \"better\" because of this facade the pills put up. I couldn't even stand to look at myself.. So I weaned off of them and felt quite a bit better for some time. I was glad to be my genuine self again. But then I remembered that my genuine self is a useless piece of shit who bums out and burdens everyone around me. So now I'm just waiting. I know the day is getting closer but I still have no clue when it'll take me. But no matter when it is it'll be too late. I've already caused everyone around me so much grief and wasted so much of their time that they'll never get back...\n",

      "suicide - I'm supposed to be \"objectively\" happy, but I'm not and I just need something. To explain a little of my backstory, I'll try and give as much details about my life without being too specific. I used to go to a really good high school that you had to test to get in to. I was projected to do very well and a lot of people, i.e. friends and family thought i would succeed and use this high school as a launching point. I crumbled under the pressure, and i felt so insecure about my place in life that all i could do was basically sit at home and play league and contemplate the meaning of self-harm. I eventually transferred out of that high school and into another one where i skimped by. I had many many many therapy sessions before i graduated high school, a majority of them focused on the societal and familial pressures that i felt were placed on me because i was not living up to the expectations that they nor I had. I graduated high school with a sub par gpa and eventually went to a college, following another one of my closest friends. My first year of college consisted of one of my first friends committing suicide, this hurt me so deep because it really altered what i had personally preconceived people with depression as. See, this particular friend was always the highlight of the group, the leader, the percy jackson main character that seemed to have everyone else follow. I was in and out of college at that point, withdrawing and dropping out basically. I eventually moved away and then got a job. I had many more therapy sessions, dealing with my deeper psychological problems ranging from self-hatred to a constant need for approval from others. I eventually stopped counseling, i had thought i got better. I started dating a girl i had met online. I decided to go back to school, because I have support systems, a drive to finish college, to provide for myself and my future significant other. However, I'm not happy. I'm not happy right now, regardless of how well I'm doing in college, how good my relationship is going, my family's health are all standard. I'm simply not happy, and i've been disassociating to the point where sometimes i can see myself from a third point of view and I don't know how to explain it to the people around me, to the girlfriend that loves and supports me. I can honestly say that for the first time in a while, I want to die, for no particular reason. I simply wish to... cease existence. But i know i can't just do that. I know how much it would hurt the people i care about. But i don't know how to stop this downward spiral that is slowly eating away at my psyche like a worm inside of an apple. Please help me, I beg you.\n",

      "suicide - i have no idea what to doi turned 18 in july. i recently found out i might have autism (and i think it explains a lot), but it was never diagnosed. someone i used to love posted things a few months ago, basically saying i was toxic and a horrible person and they wish they could hurt me back. this really fucked me up, because i didnt know i was hurting her or that i was saying anything wrong. i was really suicidal, but got advice that motivated me to forget about her, not give up, find a purpose in life (i still have the screenshot as my phone wallpaper.) this helped, and from then until a few weeks ago, i tried really hard to fight against depression. however, things got bad again when i tried to apply for a job. i freaked out ended up not going to the interview. things went downhill and i stopped leaving the house ever, or trying to cook or keep interested in anything. all i do is play video games, but i can feel myself losing interest in them too, i sit around just thinking when not playing. i know im a failure and a huge disappointment. i cant go to the community college i was planning on trying because that person goes there, and seeing her terrifies me. i know things are going bad, so i asked my mom to get a psychiatry appointment, but i heard her and my dad talking about the copay, my dad saying how its not their responsibility anymore to pay for it, but theyll help this time. this really freaks me out. i really need to get tested for autism. im also trans, and just knowing how extremely far away and expensive hormones are hurts so much. i need to get a job, but its terrifying, and there are ao few options, as my social skills are absolutely awful. i dont see how i can possibly do anything or support myself in life with my depression, anxiety, possible autism, and inability to talk to people right. i feel awful mooching off my parents. i dont want them to have to pay for me to got to the mental hospital for a 4th time, so i havent told them how bad im doing. the best option is suicide, which ive researched and have a plan i believe will work. the only thing stopping me is a thought i had. my parents raised me, sent me to therapists and hospitals and such. i feel like itd be really inconsiderate to kill myself after theyve put so much money into me. would it make that a waste? would they think raising me was a waste and regret it? normally i have the mentality that when im dead, ill be gone so it doesnt matter if people are sad or anything(i rarely care about people's feelings right anyways).\n",

Cut myself from ages 11-17, I still get flashbacks from being touched in certain areas (around my stomach or thighs) some days are hell to get through and i just feel like killing myself is the only way out because everyone around me just wants to pretend it didn't happen. when people act like its something shameful that shouldn't be brought up, you feel like a burden, like it was your fault it even happened in the first place because now everyone else has to actively suppress this terrible thing because they don't want to think about it. hiding it and not talking about it is the worst thing in the world, it can seriously destroy you from the outside in.*\n",

I spend literally the entire day on the computer just refreshing the same few sites, distracting myself with music or video games or movies because the only time I feel briefly happy is when I can forget who I am. Computers and games and television help me enjoy myself because I don't feel like I'm \"inside\" myself if that makes sense I guess, I'm just nothing- I'm just a nebulous idea totally immersed in whatever it is that I'm reading or looking at. When I have to live my life as me, away from distractions, I don't even know where to begin considering how many places I messed up. I know I could probably fix things if I try hard enough  but sometimes I just feel so fundamentally unfixable that I can't even make myself try. I feel overwhelmed bottling everything up but at the same time I feel like when I talk about it I'm just whining and feeling sorry for myself.. I sort of feel that way about this post... sorry its a little disjointed. I just have trouble getting through the day, sometimes. \n",

I already have bad dental issues I’m trying to take care of and my appointment is before my birthday. That’s already gonna cost me so much money, and now with the asshole issues I’m just spiraling.

I’m pretty sure my nana doesn’t have much time left either and know that’ll be coming soon enough. I don’t have any family besides my mom and her. My mom has her own sad story snd can’t even help me besides emotional support, and I feel so damn guilty over that already. What’s the point in anything anymore? Any light that has been in my life felt as if its all been ripped away from me. I feel another attempt again, and it’s been 4 years since I’ve failed last time. I know I’d rather go through with succeeding to kill myself than to ever go back to any psych ward. I’ve wanted to attempt to kill myself the entire 3 weeks I was in there and quickly go out due to faking being better. Everything costs so much money that only less than 5% of people have and there’s nothing that would make anything better. I’m sorry that it might seem selfish only thinking about myself.

We've been with her for over five years now and fought with more bullshit than any couple should have to due to our circumstances. Things were always hard for her in her personal life, and things were fine the first few years, but the last year or so she has been constantly depressed and has been reflecting it on everything around her. She doesn't do anything anymore, she doesn't talk to anyone anymore, and she's becoming self destructive (started smoking/cutting again). She could overcome if she got out of the situation that's holding her down (horrible family life, soul sucking job, etc) and there is every opportunity to do so, however, I've done everything in my power to help, and she refuses to help herself. She has no friends I can reach out to and try to bring her around either. Though I see it as an absolute last resort, psychiatry has been brought up, but she doesn't want to see a doctor/psychiatrist. Not for any particular reason, just the usual random dismissal that she uses to push off going to the doctor or otherwise helping herself in general. She's changed drastically since we first met, and though from time to time she will come back and act normal, the next day she disappears again. \n",

      "suicide - Hello, goodbye.The crushing loneliness that fills my heart whenever I lay down to sleep is immensely irritating. I find myself merely wanting the physical presence of another human to mitigate my sorrow, however I cannot imagine that any sane human being would even want to be near me. In my own eyes I'm worthless and the whole world would be better off without me in it. People have tried to change my mind, family, friends, therapists, psychiatrists, psychologists. All of them have failed because my self deprecation has reached astounding levels. Only matched by my apathy for any given situation. I go over silly little scenarios in my head where I meet someone and we fall in love and for that brief moment of delusion I'm happy but then reality sets in and my false happiness is shattered. So I've learned to fake my emotions, I've gotten pretty good at it. You could ask anyone who knows me and they would assure you that I'm the happiest person they've met. My mask has become near flawless. I have long since outgrown my fear of death. The real thing keeping me alive is my own aforementioned apathy. I've talked to strangers about suicide. They see it as selfish and cruel and can't see why I would want to do that to my loved ones. I however see those very same loved ones as the cruel ones. They want me to continue to suffer simply so they don't have to be sad about my death? Wasn't this life given to me? Can I not choose when and how to end it? I never asked to be born. I never wanted this life. I just want to sleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "The more I think about it the more I realize that this life is completely pointless. Why chase happiness when I can just die and not worry about it? People are always searching for their reasons to continue living but I'm one of the few who have just simply stopped looking. I realized some time ago that everything that society teaches us is in the end goal of passing on our genetic code. We go to school to get an education. So we can get good paying jobs. So that we can show to the opposite sex that we're a worthy mate. I couldn't care less about if I had children or not. My family name will most likely die with me. I wouldn't be a very good parent anyhow. I have too much anger, too much hate, too much darkness. Any offspring I would create would be even more psychologically damaged than I am. The only thing I truly want is my own death. There is no doubt in my mind that I will die by my own hands. I've already seen myself die hundreds of times in my dreams, and each time I wake up not short of breath and covered in sweat but calm and smiling because my own death comforts me. Knowing that I'll be dead soon and that the loneliness and anger will no longer consume my entire being is such an amazing thought. I have only ever self harmed once in my entire life. Part of me regrets it, not because of the scars or looks I get when people see them, but because I see self harm as a crutch. I understand a lot of people do it and it makes them feel like their in control of at least something. Among other reasons. I however would rather harm myself to the point of my life ending. The fact that I didn't, in my mind, makes me weak. I also regret it because now that I have drawn my own blood, I have this constant need to do it again. Blood and I have a very loving relationship. To me blood is intoxicating. The smell, the sight, the sound, the touch and the taste. I love them all. When I see my blood I have to fight this dark urge to not tear my body apart in order to see more.\n",

      "suicide - I don't care anymoreHi, so long story short. Just a 24 year old guy with no purpose and without any will to live.  Everything is so wicked that I can't see any meaning of life anymore. Just making one mistake after another without caring about it because I know, that I won't live so long. Just waiting for getting hit by a truck or any other accident because killing myself would make my \"family\" sad or something like that. Without any friends (i tried to connect but without any luck) So just living without caring and everyday it is harder and harder to carry on. I know that everything bad I make, is just only my mistake but I don't see any reason to change.  I dont't have any future plans so I just drift in a life and waiting for a change probably or death. So I am just another stupid jerk who can't get his life together. I am just fed up. Thanks for a reading this and spending your time because I had to get it off my chest. Cheers!\n",

      "suicide - I can't get out.I was diagnosed almost 10 years ago with a major depressive disorder. No matter what I try, I can't get rid of it. I probably have something else wrong with me like Bipolar disorder or some sort of Dissociative disorder. I don't know. Sometimes, I'll have sociopathic tendencies where I'll genuinely contemplate mutilating myself or others (mostly myself) in response to an event in life. I have periods where I'll be eating dinner happily but I'll look in the mirror and see I've gained even the smallest amount of weight and I'll contemplate grabbing a knife and cutting it out or disfiguring a part of myself like I used to as a reminder of my weight. I don't think I've gone 3 hours without thinking about ending it all in some way. Where I'm at, there's no facilities I can go to for any dedicated help. I'm afraid of breaking and hurting myself or someone else. A part of me wants to give up and take a shot in the dark, move somewhere else and wing it. Another part of me wants to flex and express the frustration and hatred I have with myself on the rest of the world. I hate who I am but I'm scared of who I could be. My mind constantly keeps going back to just doing myself in somewhere remote and quiet. It'd be the end but it's something that gives me reprieve to think about. I don't know what to do anymore or why I am the way I am. I'm not happy with my life. After about 12 years old, I don't think I ever was. \n",

      "suicide - I shouldn't feel this way, but I just...do.I recently finished my sophomore year of college, and it's my summer break. It should be a time for celebration, friends, and the sun; yet I've been feeling horribly despondent on the inside. My depression isn't something that's recently come up either.\n",

      "\n",
      "In addition to this, ever since I entered college I've had an existential crisis of sorts, in that I feel like my life has no meaning, and it makes me question why I am even in college. I have neither any passions for academic subjects nor do have any career aspirations. I don't even have any useful skills for the real world. All I can do is play video games, watch TV, and paraphrase textbooks for essays. It makes me scared that when I finish college in two years, I have to be thrust into the real world and fend for myself when I don't even feel like an adult at all.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, recently I had my first romantic relationship utterly demolished. I know it's stupid to be sad over a girl and that there are always more people, but this just feels different to me. I had never met a person that was romantically interested in me until I met this girl. I met her when I entered college, and I'd considered her one of my best friends. Yet, it's come up recently that she was never attracted to me as a boyfriend, but only sought to use me for sex while she waited to get back with an ex-boyfriend. Worst of all, she feels no remorse and doesn't even want to talk to me anymore. Our relationship or what I thought of it had lasted a few months too, so to hear that one of my best friends had been using me too only seems to add salt to my wounds. \n",
      "\n",
      "It feels like my world is falling all around me. I feel like I just want to...die. I know it's stupid for me to feel like this; I'm a man, and I should act like one, but goddamn it, my facade can only last so long. Nobody really knows that I feel like my life is worthless. To my friends and others around me, I'm a laid back, relatively happy guy with a very successful academic record (I'm set to graduate with a double major and minor), but the thing is, I'm just doing school work that I'm good at getting good grades at, not because I like it. In essence, everything feels like busy work, and I want to end it.\n",

I was honestly shocked because he was the last person I’d think would have a crush on her. And because I’m awkward I wait until the end of class to tell him that I liked her too.\n",

I tell her to enjoy her self and she then starts to get sour, bring up anything bad that has happened in the near future and bringing me down.

I had heard my mom talking about how she doesn't believe in mental illness and she complained about how much it costed. I had already tried killing myself twice. I felt like a burden. This feeling just ate away at me. I moved out of my parents at 19 to a new city, got a new job, and left University. I thought the change, independence, and growth from leaving would spark something in me, and it did. Things were going well I started exercising, going out, and being social at work.\n",
      "With this momentum I decided it was time to go back to therapy. I started saving what I could so I can afford the sessions and medication... but then i ruined everything. I got fired after because I accepted an elderly woman's coupon, I had known it wasn't valid but I thought this was a good deed, I thought I was helping someone. When loss prevention found out about it I owned up thinking honesty was best, I told them I was sorry, but it made things worse I was let go and I haven't been able to find a job. Everything I saved for therapy disappeared when bills came around. Now I just feel like a burden to my best friends that I live with. When my roommates leave for work or a party and I'm left alone in an empty apartment I can't afford anymore. I sit in my room with a plan and a note but I just settle for drinking until I fall asleep... I want to get better I want to be stronger but I feel myself slipping more and more. I don't know how to bounce back from this I keep wanting to check myself in somewhere or going to an ER telling them about my thoughts. This is always in the back of my mind and I hope it'll keep me from doing something to myself, but I'm more terrified of the monetary cost.\n",
      "suicide - I’m really scaredI’m so scared, I think about suicide all the time, every day. I wake up and my brain fantasises about it without me even controlling it. It is so fucked up. All I think about is death. Sometimes I think no one in the world wants to die as much as I do. But I just can’t do that to my family. I’ve had 10 years of mental health problems and they’ve witnessed it all. I’ve had 3 psychotic episodes that were so disturbing and I don’t k ow how I’ll ever live through with those memories. With anyone that has suffered from psychosis maybe you will know, it’s such a strange phenomenon. And all I want is a kid, it was what always got me through, knowing one day hopefully I’ll be able to bare a child. It’s what has always got me through but lately my mental health has been so bad I wonder if I’ll ever be capable of being a mother. I’m turning 27 in February and I’m absolutely terrified. I’m still living at my families because of my mental health. I just feel like my entire life is over before it’s even began because of all my struggles with me mind. I just want it to stop. I just want to be able to get up in the morning and actually want to be in this reality. Sleep is my only escape. I spent Christmas Day taking zopiclone just so I didn’t feel the pain. Because life literally hurts these days, I feel pain in my head it’s like the sadness has manifested psychically. I feel like I’m pleading for help now because as much as I want to die I still have this strong will to live. I would do anything to save someone from the point I’m at now, so why can’t I save myself. I just wish I could speak to people about this all. I come on this subreddit a lot and hardly see any positivity that I hope for. If you’re reading this please, give me any reason to live. Anything nice that makes you smile, any reasons you have. I feel so utterly alone in this. Any help whatsoever would mean the world to me. I want to stay alive\n",

      "When summer of '09 rolled around my sister and I started watching a bunch of movies together, one of which was \"Pulp Fiction\". The scene where Uma Thurman ODs on heroin made me want to try to abuse my schedule II ad/hd pills. That day, while my sister was off working at the library, I did just that. Not sure how it was going to end, I notified one of my friend ahead of time to \"call me in two minutes and if I don't answer something's gone wrong\". Nothing went wrong, but the pills did give me a slight rush. I think the want to do it was more of a placebo effect, of thinking I was a badass.\n",
      "\n",
      "So by now, I'm drunk most days out of the week along with abusing my pills. This continues for months, a few times it crosses my mind to stop doing it, and I gave it a half-assed try and gave up.\n",

      "More drinking and more pill abuse is going on now. By March of '10 I meet up with my best friend whom I've known since I was 7. I disclose in him my drinking and pill abuse and he convinces me to try and stop. So I do, I stop for about a month before I relapse. Then I'm clean for another week then relapse. Relapse. Relapse. By the summer of '10 it's not as bad as it had been but both problems still exist and I'm tempted nearly everyday.\n",

This time while it was happening I kept telling him I didn't want to do this, and I almost broke down and cried, but I wasn't gonna let him see that, so I didn't. \n",
      "\n",
      "I hadn't abused my pills in many months now, maybe 4 or 5 (pushing 6). Until last night, I was watching \"The Runaways\" the movie has many drug scenes in it and it reminded me of that distant feeling I get when I abuse, so the urge to do it overcame me and I gave in at about 2 a.m.. I stayed up the whole rest of the night being mad at myself, feeling depressed, out of my mind, and suicidal (pretty much the same feelings as the past three years). And I couldn't stop longing for a girlfriend. Wanting to be able to get up, go to this person tell them all these problems and have them say I understand.\n",

      "I work two jobs, one of them as a projectionist at a major film theater. Star Wars has ruined me. Up until that point, we had been running short documentaries, so the job was relatively active. Now my schedule keeps me there until 1am, an 8-9 hour shift consisting of MAYBE an hour of work. The rest of the time I effectively babysit the machinery in a dark, soundproof box, alone by myself, unable to leave. I get no real breaks, since the downtime during shows is considered my break. The first two weeks of this I saw the sun for maybe ten minutes. \n",

It's the only job that is willing to be flexible enough to accommodate my theater schedule (my bosses at both jobs are very good friends). The problem there is that one of my coworkers is my recent ex. We tried to make things work, and be friends, but I was genuinely still in love with her, and I'm not in a place mentally to handle it. After a month of trying, I realized I was hurting both of us, and cut it off. I didn't do it well, though. Looking back, I was childish at best, and emotionally abusive at worst. Every interaction we had made her feel guilty, even though I didn't intend to. I was horrible to her, and she didn't deserve that. At this point, we aren't speaking, and I asked my very understanding boss not to schedule us together anymore. Seeing her feels like a punch to the stomach, and I am completely terrified of running into her.\n",

Short version:  Joined the Army last year in order to get my financial shit in order (I have a useless undergrad degree, was on food stamps, have $45k in student debt). I hate it.  In June my grandmother who I loved dearly died, suddenly, a week before her 90th birthday (she'd been talking all year about how she'd be the first in her family to hit 90 and how excited she was for it). Her funeral was on my mom's (her daughter) birthday.  \n",

      "In August I finished training and ended up stationed in Bumfuck, Germany, in a fucked-up unit that embraces all the stupid bullshit I hate about the Army (basically we're treated like children and everyone's a homophobic sexist dick). I just found out that I'm probably going to be deploying next year, one month before I'm supposed to move on to my next assignment (which should be within the US at least), and I'm a coward so that TERRIFIES me.  I've got this fucking problem with my foot, they don't know what it is but my foot hurts every day, and my leadership makes me feel like a shitbag because I can't run on it. Our housing sucks - I'm 25 and living in a super-shitty dorm room with a roommate and never have any privacy. I basically have no friends here: at home my idea of a nice Friday night was maybe going to a movie, then getting a drink or two and bullshitting about literature and philosophy and things like gender theory all night, and NO ONE here does that.  An aunt is currently in the hospital suffering from major, major health problems. I hate my job. I hate the people here. They're making me take a class to get a military license and I'm scared to death of driving (I was in an accident where someone died when I was a kid, then when I borrowed my mom's car when I was 19 a pedestrian stepped in front of my car [I was going slow] and after that I basically said fuck driving, bad things happen when I do it), but this week I'm going to have to drive a fucking humvee. I'm always stressed and unhappy and were it not for the fact that I could in theory go to jail for it I don't think I'd get out of bed in the morning. I want out of the Army but don't know what I'd do.  I can't go talk to anyone because 1) that's stupid 2) there's no real confidentiality in the military and 3) they'd just tell me I'm fucking stupid; I've never even deployed.  Oh, and I fucking loathe the military-industrial complex, so I wake up every day knowing I'm an immoral sellout who gave up on my ideals for a quick easy buck.\n",

      "So, theres a lot of things that got me fucked up but the biggest thing is seeing how more supportive my mom is towards my older brother despite him achieving the same things i was last year, and me going through shit right now that i need emotional support with .. Well basically me and my brother were fat as fuck, last year i managed to lose 100 pounds, managed my money right, improved in school after fucking up a bunch, and just became a better me. Well the people around me still treated me like shit, and it was whatever because i was used to it but my mom didnt notice how hard i was fucking trying and how much i changed for the better. Fast forward towards months of drinking and hating myself because i didnt receive any love or support, i end up losing the job that i was dedicated to because i left early due to receiving an anxiety attack from them pushing me too much with work i didnt have the position for(different story).. My mom gives me shit and makes me feel worse overall, i have way more months of drinking, to the point where i think i created irreversible damage to my brain.. i feel lightheaded all the time and like im gonna have another seizure..well i end up getting another job that was better and end up losing that as well because my anxiety had been killing me, my mom calls me an idiot for not taking care of the job meanwhile praising my brother for starting to lose weight. And this is still going on, all the support for him but none for me.. i believe its because we have different fathers and mine was supposedly worse.. Anyways i gained my weight back, ive been jobless for a while already, school is going okay but im still going through all this heartache and nothing is changing just getting worse, i wish i atleast had a female to listen to me but i cant even have that because im too hasty with all this anxious feelings i get... oh well, and guy friends ? Nah, no one gives a single fuck about me or the shit ive been through. This is just a little bit of the things fucking with me. i really wish i had the balls to follow through killing myself the past two years but nothing... well i ended up cutting myself off from my \"friends\" because its clear no one cares, idk im just hoping i keep feeling this fucked up so that i can actually get the balls to kill myself, if i do then ill hang myself in my moms room so she can get what she wanted.  Theres probably so much left out here but idk im not gonna proofread it haha, i made a youtube video explaining more but theres still a lot left out, idk man im fucking problematic, like im having a panic attack right now and all that i can do is write on reddit..god why the fuck does life have to always treat me like this ? molested, i get no love or even someone to hear me out, friends mock me, girls lead me on, i get a permanent health issue because the only thing that was there for me was alcohol, why cant I have a break ? im a good person, i treat everyone with respect, idk man i guess im just weak... fuck me i just wish i had the balls to kill myself.. well if i do get the balls soon ill stream it somewhere or something, i want the world to see how it looks when a worthless motherfucker ends his shit.....\n",

I live in baltic country where everyone is pure white. My parents are white too, brother sister - white. I managed to get grandfather genes and born with dark features (he is from Pakistan). Life is horrible ,because people mistreat me wit gypsy( I really look like one of them , even I have white skin). Gypsies are hated all around the world , but here it's impossible to even live. They live in their groups , they don't give a fcuk about that. Every day in the news you can see : gypsy stole, gypsy killed , gypsy sold drugs and so on. Most horrible thing is that I'm completely normal guy , I didn't even thought people can mistreat me with them.

I used to think that wanting to kill yourself was normal, it wasn't until an assembly during my first year of middle school that I learned it wasn't. In a way I miss the time before I became aware. Back then I would try regularly, weekly. I didn't fully grasp what the consequences of my actions would be. I knew I would die and I wanted to, but I never thought of how it would have effected my loved ones. In a way it made me free. Luckily my eight year old brain also didn't grasp what would or wouldn't kill me. I can't say the same now. Since middle school I've been hospitalized a couple of times and have been in a few outpatient programs. My therapy switched from learning social skills to learning coping strategies. I have tried pretty much all of the available SNRIs and SSRIs and a few tricyclics all with no effect, I have what is known as a hyperactive metabolism. I've had twelve sessions of ECT also to no avail. I've had four Psychs tell me that they just couldn't help me, which despite having already figured that out still hurt. I'm 20 and I'm so god dammed tired. I'm tired of feeling like this, tired of being trapped and helpless, and I'm tired of being tired. I just tried to kill myself again. I think about doing it all the time. I need to make the decision not to everyday. It's been a while since I actually tried. I felt like I had ought to write a note, but all I could think of to write was \"Goodbye, sorry\". It was all I could think of to put down, and I'm not even sure it was true. I don't know why I didn't do it, I don't know why I don't. I'm not sure why I'm posting this, I think I mostly wanted to shout into the void. I think I wanted to tell someone, but couldn't think of who. It was so close\n",

My friends are all moved away or stopped getting in touch with me. The only people I talk to is family really.

Last time I used it I drank 6 bottles, although I did throw up at the end, and blacked out for a few hours. It is literally just a way to make time disappear, and is not enjoyable in any way.

But when I'm depressed, manic, and when I get in mixed states, I get completely obsessed with killing myself. I don't really know what to do.

Was there another universe before it, that all succumbed to gravity and fell back into itself? If that’s the case, how many universes have gone through their life cycles before?

Recently I had actually felt liberated because I stopped using the internet so much and had avoided social media almost completely; however, last week a passing thought has made me more paranoid and stressed than ever. A few summers ago I used grindr to talk to people since I was curious. I didn't really anything on the app itself (other than realize that I wasn't gay) but I remember making a throwaway gmail account on an old phone. I never thought about it, but I'm scared that I synced all of my personal photos and other data to that google account (google prompts you when you sign in on your phone and has it enabled by default). I'm scared that I used the same password on the grindr account as the email and that eventually some data breach will lead to someone hacking the email and gaining access to extremely personal information (sensitive pictures of me and girlfriends, contacts that were on my phone, lots of stuff I believe I deleted, etc.). The idea of this stuff one day getting hacked makes me so paranoid. I hate how careless I and stupid I was. I hate how stupid this whole ordeal is.

I'm tearing my skin since I was a child, before I just bit my hand or tore small parts but now I began tearing it a part and it makes the desk dirty with dead skin, hair and blood so I'm making the person who cleans's work harder so I'm just a pain for everybody and my new wish is to sleep and never wake up\n",

      "suicide - Whats the point, when in the long run it will be forgotten foreverEvery single action I have ever done within my life time has been useless, I will pass away one day, maybe some people may remember me and talk about me once in a while, but eventually they will die too and every single trace of me having even ever existed will be probably gone in 500 years. One day the earth will get engulfed in the sun and it will be as if I have never existed at all, like I have always been nothing. Anything I do now will be forgotten, whats even the point in doing anything, there will be no divine power from above rewarding us for the good things we have done or punishing us, there will be nothing forever, when people look into their future they see careers, start a family, live a happy life, all I see is nothing forever wainting for me just to cease of existence for rest of eternity. I am killing myself, I only eat junk food, I chain smoke at least 1 pack of cigarettes every day and I get black out drunk every other day, I hate my life, Ive got nothing to look forward to, every single person I have ever met hates me. I wasn't meant for this world, as the line goesfrom the song Riders on The Storm by The Doors \"into their world were thrown\", I didn't ask to be here, I just started existing suddenly and experiencing all the bad things in this world. There is nothing left for me here, and I can't see myself living much longer, the end is near I can smell it.\n",
      "suicide - I don't know what happenedI don't know what to say right now. My life just changed completely and I can't handle it. I've been receiving treatment for depression since I was a teenager. Now I'm 31 and I've accomplished nothing. I started working when I was 14. Had to quit when I was 19 for my mental health. Started college but quit halfway through my degree. I was approved for social security disability shortly after that. I don't leave my house unless it's to see my doctor. I don't have any friends or acquaintances. None. Three years ago I realized how much my loneliness was affecting my life. I posted on Reddit and ended up meeting a guy. My life changed after meeting him. We wanted the same things. The same future. We got along really well. Ended up meeting in person a few months after talking. Fell in love. He broke up with me a week ago. We're still in contact daily. We still love each other. He still wants me to work on improving my life and to see me doing well. But he said he needs time to do some important things, he needs to buy a car, he wants to look into buying a home because he recently had a nightmare of a situation with his landlord. He really is doing those things, but I doubt that's the real reason for why this is ending. I dated when I was a teenager and in my early 20's. He was different from anyone I've been with before. He made me feel so loved. I was improving my life without even realizing it because he made me feel so great. Before I met him I was showering once a month. I wasn't in a good place. The light that he brought into my life was just... indescribable. I was taking care of myself, showering daily, doing chores around both of our places, going shopping, going out to eat, running errands, everything that normal people do. He made me want to be a better person. My life was improving so much. My doctor noticed, my mom noticed. He knew all about my mental health problems and the support he gave me was always perfect. I just can't handle my emotions right now and I'm scared of where my thoughts are heading. I've been miserable for over half of my life. I had three years of pure happiness, and it was suddenly taken away without warning. I had no warning this was coming. He was the only person in my life. My whole support system. It's not that I want to die because he broke up with me. It's so much more than that, so many things I can't put into words. I don't like where I'm heading and I need help because I can feel myself losing my will to live every day. I had everything taken away from me. At least before I met him, I had no idea what real happiness was. I had no idea what I was missing. Now it's gone and I don't have the energy or will to try again. I don't feel like I'm capable of handling this. I feel stupid for having these thoughts, I feel like I should be able to handle a mutual breakup because I'm an adult. But this was so much more than a breakup. He gave me so much strength to fight my depression and work on myself. And now I'm left dealing with both depression and heartbreak and I know it's my own fault for putting so much trust in another person. I need help. I'm so close to giving up\n",

      "I have a normal life and I live with my mom, dad, and sister. But the thing you need to know is that I am a VERY socially awkward person. Ever since I was in elementary school I was picked on because I was shy and different from most people. I was glad when I left the school. Now I am currently 17 and in my Senior year. High school has been a bit of a step up as I am no longer being harassed but I am still very lonely. I've never had a REAL friend before. I've only had a few people who I have actually gotten along with and have had conversations with but I either never get to really see them again or they have moved on to somewhere else. I don't think the kids at my school really even care about me much. Sometimes people just walk past me without ever telling me \"hello\", even when I look upset some of my fellow classmates don't even care. Whenever people DO ask me what's wrong they only tell me a few nice things just to make me feel better. The people who do ask just carry on with their lives. I don't even get invited to most social outings. I really don't feel important when it comes to my peers around me and I don't think I would fit in with many other people at my school. I think the only friend I pretty much have right now is my older sister and it's not like I have her to talk to all the time. I know I am not the best at conversations but maybe if people gave me a chance and got to know me better maybe people would see me more than just some quiet, shy girl. Too many people I know really act obnoxious, loud, and seem to have different interests from me. I have been getting really depressed over time about the fact that I can't make any real friends and I was beginning to think about killing myself. I was planning to do it tonight but at the same time I don't want my family members to get sad and depressed now if I do this. What do you think about my life? Should I kill myself or do I have a chance at getting things better for me in the future?\n",

      "The title basically says it all. I grew up being forced into a wheelchair when I was capable of walking. Got bullied for it. Whole childhood I was emotionally neglected by both my parents and singled out. I will never forget how my mom told me “you are my child. I love you but I will never like you”. Always being told how they don’t understand how I have friends. They told me I was a mean child. That I am the reason behind my other siblings mental illness. I can’t do anything right. Every boyfriend I’ve ever had has cheated on me - Including my current partner who lives with me at my parents house. I have no hobbies, no close friends, not good at anything. I attempted suicide at age 15, my mom told everyone I was attention seeking and was lying and refused to take me to the hospital after I overdosed - my cousin pleaded after my mom told everyone they weren’t allowed to take me and finally did. Was raped at age 15, he took my virginity and then died last year. I’ve been bulimic since I was 14; I’m 20 now. I’ve lost all hope in life. Everyday is worse than the last. I found diary entries from when I was 5 talking about how I was going to hang myself. More diary entries from when I was 7. And 10. Nothing’s changed so when will it ever. It was supposed to get better and it never has. I feel like I have ruined my entire family. I have friends but no one chooses to reach out to me - or take any interest in inviting me anywhere. I’ve truly always believed I was better off dead and I’ve been proven right in my opinion. I just want the numbness to end. My mom told me if I ever killed myself it would ruin her mental health and my siblings, she says she would kill her self too leaving my 7 other siblings without her and with my abusive dad.

The moment that 49% turns into a 51%, whatever the belief, no matter how radical, is inherently true, due to the nature of right and wrong in these kinda of political/philosophical situations: it's completely subjective.

      "non-suicide - Today I got stuck in a rocking airplane playground toy A friend and I decided to see if we could both fit in this rocking airplane contraption. The most difficult tactic was getting all 4 of our knees in, as I am slightly taller and there was a bar going across the seat. We tried many tactics (leaning the airplane forward, going knees first, short person first, etc.) and ended up fitting! We were so proud of ourselves, as you can see in the photo below. After posing for the photo, we tried to get out. I had sunken quite a bit into the seat, so I couldn’t slip through out until my friend got out. She couldn’t get out until I moved my knees. Then, realization hit: we were stuck. I filmed the whole thing, and I can see the exact moment where our faces fall and we both mumble, “f*ck.” To add to our predicament, it was starting to rain and we could hear thunder. There would be a complete downpour within 10 minutes. Fortunately, I saw someone I knew and yelled for them. They and their laughing friends gave me the motivation to violently tug myself out of the seat with all of my might. After a few minutes of sheer thigh torture as I wrenched my upper body and my friend shoved my knees, my legs had slipped under the bar and out of the airplane. We were out! The people I knew promptly left, and my friend and I became stranded at the park in the middle of a storm for the next half hour. Is my spirit crushed? Nah. My confidence lost? Not a chance. The only part of me that felt any pain during this endeavor was my thighs. \n",

      "suicide - Guys, I think I've posted this before, but things have only gotten worse. So if anybody doesn't know, I (15)  live with my dad and step mom, my little step sister (12) and my step brothers (17 and 21). My step brothers and I get along just fine, and the oldest one I learned was the bestest friend that I've ever had. But let me tell you what we all know about my step-sister. She is smart as hell with a tested IQ of 120, no joke. Yet she is spoiled to all hell and our parents treat her like she is incapable of doing anything wrong, she always gets excused out of everything, only nice to you when its convenient to her. All of us are required to work our butts off making sure the house is clean every day but she doesn't have to because she has \"headaches\" which she apparently gets only when she has to clean. And of course if you say anything about her to the parents (god forbid) it will get turned on us and that she never fits in with anyone, she gets headaches, she never gets help with schoolwork (btw she does but she pretty much makes us do it and if we don't, she whines to mommy saying we didn't help her.) Always treats me like I'm stupid, always acts like she is better than all of us but is so helpless when its in front of her mom. \n",
      "Btw one thing that is NOT tolerated and is punished heavily for in this house is lying. She is the biggest liar in this whole household, but the parents don't believe it. If nobody says anything when asked who did something, my step mom gets enraged, because nobody is being honest. Its almost always my step sister who doesn't say a damn thing. We are all forced to fess for what she does, and apparently I'm the liar and manipulator, to the point where my step mom just tolerates me at this point. \n",
      "So anyways, I need advice here: My step mom is diabetic and she had bought some french silk pie, which she couldn't find for months. She bought it because chocolate was something that would bring her sugars up when they were low, and it was her favorite. By the time she had her first piece, that was the last piece in the pie because people ate it. I admit I had 1 piece. My dad had like 3, and there were still 3 not known who ate them. Of course, my poor precious innocent never lying step sister \"only had one and that's when she asked\", when all the other 3 of us siblings knew damn well she had the other pieces, the look on her face made it so obvious. But she kept with her story. So I was forced to say that I lied and I had the other pieces, and my punishment was that my step mom didn't want anything to do with me for a week, she didn't want me talking to her, and she wasn't going to talk to me. Pretty much she is going to pretend like I don't exist for the next week, for punishment on \"lying too much\" which I'm sure my step sister loved because she hates me and is way too protective of her mom and gets overly jealous when anyone is near her. Yes guys, we give her chances to fess up. There was a time where we all waited literally an hour and 15 minute with the parents staring at us getting angrier and angrier, until plates were being thrown and broken, food was going all over the floor, threats were being made, and my step mom was threatening to leave and go to a hotel for a few days. Well known fact that she despises lying. So finally I had to fess up, and I spent my Valentines day alone because of it. First time Ive ever heard my step brother swear, first time anyone ever heard him swear (hes a big prude) was at me when he told me \"fuck you\" in tears, because he honestly thought I was the one who did it, which makes sense because I \"fessed up\" when it should have been my step sister. When we mention anything about her lying, we always get accused of \"throwing her under the bus\" and blah blah excusing poor step sister who never lies and is perfect and is always picked on. And I can't just ignore her because we get in trouble if we don't include her in literally anything, everything she HAS to be apart of. But every time she just ruins everything with her attitude and that she has to control everything. And she hates me in particular for some reason and tries doing just small things at a time to make my life a living hell. My step mom still isn't talking to me, and my step sister even though I keep telling her that I'm not allowed to talk to her but she keeps rubbing it in pretending to forget \"Oh why don't you go talk to her then?\" \"Can you ask her something for me?\" What the hell do I do guys, I can't handle any of this anymore. Her step brothers also have to deal with her bullshit too, and I feel bad because apparently they had it 10000× worse as she was growing up and their lives were horrible because of it. Please, advice, or comfort. I need some serious help.\n",

      "Don’t know if this is needed but I am a 17 year old male. I’ve been severely depressed for about a year and a half now. It is currently my senior year. Last year I suffered from a horrible concussion which was given to me when a senior punted a football inside the super small locker room before PE at my school. The ball hit me on the forehead, I tripped on my pants (I was in the midst of changing) and I slammed the back of my head onto the wall behind me and then onto the concrete floor. I was unconscious for awhile. When I woke up nobody was in the room except for a teacher and my two friends. I don’t really remember much more of the day. I later was diagnosed with a severe concussion and am still mildly affected by it. I missed months of school and the person who punted the football (student body president, super popular) never apologized. It turns out he ran out of the room when it hit me and he went to play basketball. I managed to get through junior year and I took the ACT (I got into the school I wanted a few weeks ago). When my brain began to heal, I started to get severely depressed. I  actually began to get depressed a month before my concussion in October of 2018. I ended up breaking up with my girlfriend at homecoming that month because I felt I couldn’t put my all into our relationship. We are still good friends and she’s been supporting me. Anyways, my depression flared up in October of 2019, leading me to being put in a PHP (partial hospitalization program). I was going to the program which taught CBT and DBT skills during the day and going home during the night.   After two months of PHP, things weren’t looking so great. My care team switched my meds which in turn made me really suicidal and I began to self harm. At this time they decided to send me back to school. They said “we send suicidal people back to school all the time” I would self harm in school and have active thoughts. Eventually PHP wanted me to come back. A few days later, they decided to send me to the hospital. The issue is that it was a Friday night and no hospitals had beds. We had to drive to a northern suburb (don’t want to give away my location) and I was placed in the ER for 3 and a half days. They tried to send me to an inpatient hospital 2-3 hours away southward. I was eventually admitted to the hospital I was staying at on Monday. I stayed in inpatient for a full week and my meds were changed again. I began to have less suicidal thoughts and almost no self harm. I was able to spend time with my family over the holidays. I currently am back in school and it is finals starting this Tuesday. I just ended my time at PHP and am now doing an after school program at the same place. I am doing half days at school with only my needed classes to graduate. I currently am writing this instead of studying because I need to get it all off my chest. I just want to graduate and go to college. I’ve missed so many classes that I may not be able to graduate. I truly am worried. I also can’t get the hospital out of my head. I feel like I have PTSD from it. I know this experience was mild compared to almost everyone else’s. I feel like I shouldn’t even be complaining. I’m probably just gonna end it tomorrow.\n",

In 2004, General Electric Aviation began producing more powerful T700-GE-701D engines, rated at 2,000 shp (1,500 kW) for AH-64Ds.[49]\n",

      "The crew compartment has shielding between the cockpits, such that at least one crew member can survive hits. The compartment and the rotor blades are designed to sustain a hit from 23 mm (0.91 in) rounds. The airframe includes some 2,500 lb (1,100 kg) of protection and has a self-sealing fuel system to protect against ballistic projectiles.[50] The aircraft was designed to meet the crashworthiness requirements of MIL-STD-1290,[51] which specifies minimum requirement for crash impact energy attenuation to minimize crew injuries and fatalities. This was achieved through incorporation of increased structural strength, crashworthy landing gear, seats and fuel system.\n",

The M230E1 can be alternatively fixed to a locked forward firing position, or controlled via the Target Acquisition and Designation System (TADS).[56][57] On more modern AH-64s, the TADS/PNVS has been replaced by Lockheed Martin's Arrowhead (MTADS) targeting system.[58]\n",

      "\n",
      "For a long time now I've been terrified of dying. The concept of an eternal oblivion waiting for me upon my death fills me dread and raw terror. I've had these feelings concurrently alongside a long period of Depression, General Anxiety and Panic Attacks. I've tried avoiding these feelings anyway I can. I am an Alcoholic, and I heavily abuse Benzodiazepines, Opiates, and other miscellaneous hypnotics when I can. I went through a large period of heavily abusing cough syrup after an upsetting period of my life. It detached me from my feelings; it detached me from reality as a whole. I was consuming several bottles a week for extended periods of time. In retrospect, it was clearly just me trying to escape the misery of being alive without resorting to the terminal solution (suicide). I feel as though this has irreparably damaged my brain. My memory is a constant haze, the days bleed into each other like watercolor paints.\n",
      "\n",
      "The shift in my mood probably started in my tenth grade of school. My grades dropped dramatically (in elementary school I was known as very bright and people commented on how I enjoyed being at school more than at home). By the 12th grade I had dropped out. I no longer had the motivation to do anything. By this point I still enjoyed to some extent old pleasures such as movies and video games. That changed soon after, as I lost most of the joy in almost everything I once loved to do. This is the point where I became a heavy addict. I had two close friends at the time. My rampant alcoholism was a major contributing factor to losing one of them. The alcohol numbed my depression and killed my anxiety, at the cost of me being a miserable excuse for a person that no one wanted to be around. During this time I tried an SNRI medication with no success, and had already seen two therapists, both of which were of absolutely no help.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then there came a catalyst that changed my life almost overnight. I bought, prepared, and consumed a psychoactive medicine known as Ayahuasca. How I managed to undergo such a potentially terrifying experience with my level of Anxiety I will never know. After it was done, I was better. The gray depressing world that surrounded me flooded with color and reality was no longer suffocating me like I was in an endless ocean of water with no help or hope. I started enjoying hobbies again. I was no longer getting black out drunk every night on Alcohol (and sometimes during the mornings too). The only thing that hadn't improved was the total lack of motivation towards anything, but it was still an incredible improvement and exceeded my wildest expectations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fast forward ten months. Ever since that experience my mood had stayed steady. Then, things began to go downhill again. It was gradual at first. The anxious knot in my chest appeared, and wouldn't go away. The world became dull and intimidating. My thoughts turned overwhelmingly negative and I was experiencing long stretches of what I can only describe as incredible dysphoria. I'm trying to graduate high school again (I'm 20) but it's very likely I'm going to fail yet again. My anxiety and lack of motivation makes it seem like I'm going to have no future at all. My father who I still live with has threatened to kick me out of the house if I don't get a job or graduate high school. I don't know if he will actually go through with it. I couldn't survive being homeless, there's just no way. I only have one friend left and I doubt they'd be willing to let me stay there (they live with their parents as well). The last two months has been the worst. I've been average at 4-5 panic attacks a week. Recently I started heavily abusing Benzodiazepines to treat my Anxiety and Panic Attacks. It provides relief, but I always inevitably overdo it. The last few days have been such a murky haze. Only pieces and fragments of my days are easily recalled due to the amnesiac effects of the Benzodiazepine. \n",

      "For the second time in my life my mind turned to suicide. The first was during my heavy Alcoholism stage, when I had a hookup for Opiates. I knew I could get Morphine from him, go down to the pharmacy and buy some syringes, and intentionally overdose intravenously. I wanted the misery and Anxiety to end. But I also terribly scared. Paralyzed with fear over the idea of nothingness forever. That particular time the fear of dying outweighed my fear of living. \n",

      "This time, I'm not so sure. I've been thinking of buying the parts required to build an exit bag, fill it with Nitrous Oxide, and go out peacefully like a giggling fool. I know that things will eventually get better. They've already gotten better once before. What terrifies me is if I'll be able to hold on until that time comes again. It's just so difficult. So difficult... I don't know if I have the willpower to make it through again. I have more Ayahuasca, but my anxiety has gotten bad enough that I am paralyzed by fear to try it again. It kills me inside to know that I have a sister and best friend that would be devastated if I ever went through with it. My friend means so much to me, and they've already had to deal with the suicide of sibling. I don't want to have to place this burden on them.\n",

When I first met my boyfriend, we were both in a similarly pessimistic position in our lives. A bit stuck but wanting to slog on and hopefully journey to relative happiness. We have propped each other up now for around 3 years, and actually (I think) in quite a healthy and supportive way. I love him so, so much. I truly believe that we have a unique connection that I couldn’t find with anyone else. I am a lot more deep in my understandings of the world than him. Although he loves me, he doesn’t believe in the idea of a one true love and he has never been with another woman. He believes himself, though not through medical diagnosis, to perhaps be on the autism spectrum and can struggle with emotionally driven trains of thought. I was attracted to him initially as he never conducted any of the bull relationship politics at the beginning of the relationship, and I always hated the men that I dated previously that did that. His treatment of me was so pure and so honest.\n",

Although he loves me, I understand that my approach to life must make things hard for him. But this is the problem. He loves me and will not leave me despite me stressing that I would always support him regardless. We have already faced some rough times in such a short relationship (3 years) such as family deaths, horrible job situations, I uprooted and moved 2 hours away from family to live with him, etc. I want him to soar but I am holding him back, and not by my own choice. He loves me too much to make that sacrifice for himself. I love him enough to do just that, and I know that if I isolate myself from him and continue to live then he will fight to get me back. Part of me thinks he just doesn’t want to be alone.\n",

I want some meaningful conversations with little cousins to occur naturally so that I can instil a bit of the wisdom I did learn in my short life and function as a bit of hope when they know that I am gone.

The only people that truly came to support me were my middle school classmates. I've had a better family in school than hoe for most of my life. So to set an ultimatum, by the end of this year, if nothing changes, I'm just going to take my father's firearm, and shoot myself in the head with it. Because it's better to not live than being drowned alive. Of course I've been thinking long and hard about whether I should go through with it, but it just seems that my dead husk might as well be a saving grace in the eye of my parents. And it seems that I'll either become stronger through this, or leave this world forever. I have friends, some would maybe go out of their way to help someone. I'm afraid of what damage I could cause by leaving them so suddenly. My brother, the person I love and envy the most, has never gone through what I've gone through. He doesn't get berated nor abused as the baby of the family. And I just take the blunt of the blows like some punching bag. But even punching bags break. I don't really know what I'm after from this post. Maybe a bit of solace and empathy through other people going through the same experiences, or to also edge myself just that much closer to a blissful kiss of death. I guess I'm also looking for a reason to live; to defy the odds and win this war of attrition against them. I don't want your pity; I want a reason to smile and laugh some more under the ruins of a wall that my parents have ravaged. I'm sorry for the wordiness; it just seems so much more empathetic and real, writing an image from words. But hey, thanks for reading. Reddit is a pretty cool place, and I've come many times back here to find solace from the real pain that leaps with my every step. Goodbye. This may be the last chapter that I will ever come across. \n",

Everytime they bring it up or teachers like to constantly bring up how I'm a fucking failure I just beat my stomach until it wrenches with pain and I lay on the floor for hours until it goes away.

I've decided that the moment my pet dog dies I will kill myself. All I want is a way to end everything. I've figured that 4-5 terrifying seconds after jumping off the Manhattan bridge for an eternal bliss is a steal, best bargin in my life.

I'm looking for just some chill people to just chat and possibly play some games with whenever I have the time, though I'll be completely honest, being friends with me comes with a big disclaimer as I've had to deal with some fucked up shit the past 5 years and am still suffering the effects of said stuff, so because of that if I happen to be in a mood or something it's most likely because I'm having a rough day which unfortunately can be pretty often for me, if you want to know anything about me just ask me any question at all and I'd be happy to answer!\n",

      "suicide - Just wanna talk with someone right nowHi, I don't really know what to do. This pandemic is really taking a toll on my mental health. I know my friends are supportive, but I just don't know how to tell them that I need help and support. I know everyone's dealing with a lot of things now like I do so I don't wanna bother them. I just want to talk with someone right now, or maybe at least get everything out from my system by writing it here. I do talk with my friends sometimes, but I really can't tell them exactly what's going on in my mind right now. I've been trying to talk to my SO too, but I don't know, he seems not to care, and that hurts me, big time. I know he has problems too, and I'm not asking too much from him either, but I really do feel that he doesn't care about me. \n",

I mean, don't get me wrong, nothing's wrong with my family, I love them, and it's just me that has problems. I can't seem to stop thinking about my childhood traumas, like, yeah, I get it, it all happened in the past, but I just can't let it go. You see, I was physically abused as a child. I mean, it's normal here in our place to beat up a child when that child \"did\" something wrong as a way of teaching them discipline, but come on, just because it's \"normal\" or many people are doing it, doesn't mean it's right. So yeah, that's where I'm coming from; although that happened ages ago, and it's no longer happening now. \n",
      "\n",
      "But yeah, I'm still traumatized by those events, and I can really notice that I'm the one who's being toxic in this house. I get irritated or angry easily here, although I'm not like that outside, or when I'm with other people, because I'm not really like that, but I'm somehow easily triggered when I'm around them or when I'm in the house. I don't know why I'm being like this, but sometimes, I feel like I deserve an apology from them, specially from my mother why I became like this. As selfish as it sounds, but that's how I really feel and I just wanna get this off my chest. Like, how can they be okay while I'm not? I don't want to be angry, but I just can't stop, it's not that easy, but it's also hurting me, because I also love my mom, more than I can actually imagine. I'm also angry at myself, for being angry at my mom. And it hurts me so much that I just want to kill myself already, but I can't, because first of all, I don't have the guts to do that, although I tried it before, but I got scared, and lastly, I know deep in my heart that  I don't really want to die. What I want is to just forget everything. Well, I gotta admit, there are times when I really wanna do it, like I really wanna die, but I can't, because I know that'll hurt my mom so bad, and I don't want that to happen. So yeah, I don't really know what to feel. I feel so worthless, lost, scared, etc, idk.\n",

And I end up planning my suicide 100%, and I'm often egged on by the contents or the people in the dream. Today everyone around me knew I was about to do it and they were planning on what to do afterwards. I don't think I see the people in my life in this light IRL, fucked up as they are, yet I didn't question it in the dream and it just strengthened my resolve to kill myself. I woke up sort of just before I actually killed myself, and I got up and out of bed and looked around, ready to jump! I caught myself within seconds and just stood there, confused as fuck.

As far as I can tell the only universally agreed upon reasons why someone shouldn't kill themselves is that it would be traumatising for their family and friends, and that maybe, just maybe, they will one day be happy. \n",

Principally I'm against using this as a reason, but for emotional reasons I haven't managed to do that to my family yet. The other reason doesn't make any sense to me either. Sure, many people want to try and push through the agony in the hopes that they will one day be happy, but for me it's not worth it. I don't deny that my depression can be treated or even \"cured\", but it's not like that's going to happen overnight. Even if I do eventually reach a point where I consider life to be worth living, I'm not going to reach that point for another couple of excruciatingly painful years at the very least.

The only thing I get out of talking to people about being suicidal is the feeling that no one understands what's it's like to stand where I do. It doesn't even feel like people are trying to understand. It's like I'm being tortured with no guaranteed way to escape and I have a cyanide capsule resting in my mouth, but all around me there are people standing shouting \"No you can't do that because it's wrong.

      "I have had an OK life, much better than most of people had luck to have. I mean,I grew up in a 3rd world country, I saw a civil war as a kid, and  then my father got sick like very sick and I am lucky he survived, only 1 out of 10000 people that have his condition survive it. He lost so much fucking weight I still remember looking at him and not going to him to give him a hug.He was like a walking zombie, Imagine a grown man 6'0 with only like 70 lbs on him. He was just like a zombie. I always regret not giving him a hug. I wish I had. During school life was not easy as well, I was the only muslim kid there and I had my fair share of beatings, bullying and all that bulshit that comes with it. My father was there always to support me and I finished as the best student of the whole generation. In highschool it was a bit better, I formed a team and competed for NASA Space Apps Challenge and actually my team won the 3rd place in the world. That feeling was so good. Then I applied to the most prestigious international chain of highschools UWC and got awarded a full ride to go and finish my last 2 years in Hong Kong and it was the very first time ever a minority was given a scholarship from the country I came from. My father was super proud he even borrowed money to come and see my graduation. He could not believe it. I did something no one had ever done as a minority from my country. I got a full ride to University of Oklahoma, and there my struggles with suicidal thoughts started. I was even put in a state hospital because I seeked helped from a therapist and he put me 3 days in a hospital, the most stressful and fearful time of my life, being around mentally ill people was so so frightening. I can't help it guys and I can not tell my father as well, he would be heartbroken. He always wanted the best for me. It made me miss classes and struggle with school. I decided to stay a year at home so I recover but I just made up a reason to my father, he was not happy but made me comeback this semester and I just can't I think I can not, I lied that I am coming back and I am actually just staying in Copengagen in a hostel and he thinks I am in the states. I think this is the end. I am just now thinking what should I write as my last words to my father. He is such a great and successful guy and I failed in every possible way. I am so sorry guys to waste your time, I just wanted to share my story because I don't really have any other person to share it with. Not anyone I trust enough anyway.\n",

I cant stop thinking about it though, I feel sick when ever I think about it. The thing is everyones treating me like a complete buzzkill now bc Ive sworn to myself im not going down that path, even though my best friend wont even tell me things about this anymore. I also stopped because my parents do so much for me and I don’t even want to come close to disappointing them. Im currently doing extremely well in school, and i am not about to give all of that up. I feel so guilty and tbh it just feels good to let it out.\n",

      "\n",
      "I’m currently just living life with no direction and no idea where it’s gonna take me. Without going into too many horrible details, I had a messed up childhood - was physically and emotionally abused a lot by my mum over anything, mostly stupid tiny things and academics. Ended up in a girls’ grammar school where I thrived for a fairly long time, everything was going alright for some time, even though the abuse from my mum was still going on for a while. I guess I was a much stronger person back then and managed to learn how to keep living this double life and just be this completely different, happy person at school whilst coming home later on and just having abuse hurled at me. I made a fair amount of friends, had one very close friend and was also someone who got quite high grades and performed well academically. Essentially, I was generally able to live something close to a normal and enjoyable life. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then, around 2 years ago before my GCSEs, I crashed and burned. I started self destructing in Y11 after falling into a depressive cycle and started cutting myself off from my then friendship group. I’d no longer sit with them at lunch, my behaviour became a lot more impulsive and erratic, started doing my own thing, tried to keep myself busy to detract from the fact that I was hurting badly inside and I just preferred my own company all of the time. Then, a couple of months before my exams, I hit a new sorta low and all of the coping mechanisms I’d learned had just completely gone out of the window. I had nowhere to go, just trapped in my own head and eventually was just forced to talk to someone. Somehow, I ended up with decent GCSE grades still but I knew I wouldn’t be able to keep that up for A-Level.\n",
      "\n",
      "Y12 came and I found myself a little dis-oriented. Ended up joining a completely different friendship group, didn’t feel like myself at all. Pretended to be someone I wasn’t. Ended up in a relationship with a girl who ended up messing me up a bit. Grades kinda plummeted. Still depressed as hell but managed to put on this facade that I was alright by acting like the fool in the friendship group, allowing myself to become the butt of all jokes, not really caring about much anymore. Y13 came, ended up breaking up with my ex. (Wasn’t the best of break ups. We became very distant in the summer. Tried to ask her if  we could talk via WhatsApp, she read the message and didn’t reply. Ended up asking her, then she just told me she didn’t like me anymore with almost a smile on her face. Told me she had been ignoring me for weeks so there was that. Kinda fucked me up emotionally).\n",
      "\n",
      "My current friendship group also causes me a lot of problems. I don’t feel I always belong. There’s a clear divide within it, the tension is noticeable whenever I sit down in the area. It’s a toxic environment sometimes and definitely one that doesn’t do me any good. Surely, it shouldn’t get to me that much, but it does and I wish I could always be doing my own thing and just focus on work all of the time, but I’ve also learned that’s just a sad existence. \n",
      "\n",
      "I feel like I have no where to turn to, no one who really cares sometimes. A big problem is also just the fact that my childhood has caused me to become so very emotionally repressed, unable and too fearful to become close to anyone again. I just always feel like a giant burden on my friends, scared of ever truly being myself around them, in fear of what I do being laughed at, trivialised or mocked. The way I act around them, I just always feel like I’m bringing them down, yet I always have the notion that they don’t really care. They tell me that I always look really depressed recently and I just don’t care enough to really respond or do something about it. I ended up blocking them all on WhatsApp in a moment of irrational fear regarding getting close and forming meaningful friendships. I don’t really want them to know me while I’m going through whatever I am. I don’t want them to worry about things I should be worrying about. This weekend was the weekend I was planning on hanging myself really. I can’t afford therapy, my mum won’t pay, she doesn’t understand that I’m capable of even feeling like this. I’m just stuck with no where to go even though some part of me, deep down wants to get better. \n",

My insecurities and feelings of self-loathing have transpired outside of my normal life &amp; into work and personal relationships. And I can’t control it. I’ve been feeling on the edge for the past few years, and my patience for things has deteriorated to the bone, even the smallest inconveniences send me spiraling emotionally. I was kicked out of my engineering program at school for poor grades &amp; forced to switch to a less honorable major, my coworkers treat me as if i’m incompetent after being there for 2 years &amp; the fast paced environment is getting to me, I inherently feel like i’m never enough in any sort of friendship or relationship &amp; just feel like i’m biding my time till I get pushed aside. I hate being 24 years old still living with my parents &amp; ultimately I hate feeling like i’m on a treadmill of self-pity going nowhere fast. I promised myself I’d end my life if I get through college to make my family proud &amp; earn an iota of self-worth/self-respect. I don’t see myself accomplishing anything worthwhile while I feel like this. And its increasingly difficult to just act okay around people. I crave to just feel like I’m worthy or feel like I belong. I guess if anyone relates to feeling like this, how do you cope or keep your feelings in line to get through the day?\n",

I think truly the only thing that keeps me going at this point is my dog.. and the mere fact that I must have been a reason I kept going. Through all the pain to be where I am now, but I'm really unsure. I've been thinking more and more and talking less. I really need some advice right now and Reddit is the only place I can really turn..\n",

      "suicide - I need help pleaseI feel that I’m going to end my life soon. I’m to exhausted from life. My life has just gone down hill since i turned 18. I got married at age 18 and divorced at 21. I supported my family and made it where my ex could be a stay at home mom. One thing that really frustrated me was that I had to clean and make dinner every night. She would leave early in the morning and get back right before I had to leave for work at night so I’d be up for 48 hours sometimes. At court I only got 40% custody of our daughter and thousands of dollars in lawyer debt. Even tho I had evidence of a mentally unstable mother. The mom is a fucking bipolar wack job. I don’t want to get into detail with. She never takes  her on her days. I love having my daughter but why am I paying child support when she never has her.  The Mother is always having a stay at a mental health hospital at least twice a year. I lost my job recently and haven’t been able to pay bills or child support. My car is broken down and I have no money to repair it. I haven’t eaten in two days. I don’t even a fucking dime. I AM drained. I know someone has it worse I should be grateful for what I have bla bla bla. Well I’m sick and fucking tired of being walking on talking advantage of from everyone. I did not proof read this so sorry if I sound uneducated haha. I’m 23 and done\n",
      "suicide - última nota (last note)I have left this writing to express the reasons that have led me to make this decision. Things that no one can confess or that if they were to confess will not be taken seriously and would be mocked. It is not something that has emerged in a matter of months, much less days. This I have been able to feel little by little, even see and feel, since I began to have a little judgment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Life always seemed mysterious to me, it is something that defies the infinite uncertainty of things; it is a ray of light in the immense darkness. This situation is not entirely graceful, in fact it soon becomes quite miserable. The individual challenge always ends up being useless with the looming of death, but life itself, as a whole, persists in vain. The course of life seemed futile, inert and bland. A vicious circle that aims to continue life itself through generations. Everything that is done daily, unconsciously fulfills a purpose that obeys life, its perpetuity. Soon I was immersed in rot and \"spiritual\" misery.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not everyone can perpetuate it, in fact, nature has developed different mechanisms in each species that ensure that those that continue it are those that possess (genetic) characteristics that meet the needs that life demands of them, in order to avoid the annihilation of the species and being able to obey the will of life. Those who do not comply are ruthlessly discarded. As if his existence had represented a simple error, worthy of a spit. They are here only to experience rejection and misery. The worst corresponds to them almost as a right. If they were to make the mistake of recklessly breeding offspring, they would also fall into misery except for a few rare cases. \n",
      "\n",
      "In the end our purpose in this world is only a valid one. The one to reproduce. Everything else lies in the human imagination that paradoxically was given to us as a tool for survival but that, through the years, acquired other uses that mock life itself. Becoming an artist, for example. By the way, I want to say that there have been characters who have transcended all this crap and have been able to see beyond this torment. They are truly wise and reach unimaginable confines for the average subject. These subjects are rare and not all enjoy such a release. All the rest of us obey the will to live, sublime and omnipresent.\n",
      "\n",
      "My consciousness was realizing this foolish matter. I also became aware of my shortcomings and about the place I occupy on this earth. Everything I did on a daily basis was acquiring a bitter taste. Nothing that used to bring me joy does it anymore. The only moments that bring me peace, even if only for a few seconds, is to listen to a piece of art, sometimes the evening cloudscape, some tree frolicking to the rhythm of the wind, the song of the birds and the sky, with its clouds by the day and stars at night. Nature so ruthless is also giver of the most beautiful events that my senses can perceive, even so, despair makes none of this achieve comfort me anymore.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's funny to hear well-adjusted people talk about their false morals, slapstick such as: beauty is subjective, we are all smart in our own way, God loves us all and has a purpose for us all, etc. The hypocrisy is so obvious and its irony sickens me. It is repeated so much that it is socially wrong to deny such statements when in reality their rejection and their passive contempt for people inferior to them is evident.\n",
      "\n",
      "This world turned out to be absurd, insignificant and full of bestiality, in the end we are only animals, and just as the weak and maladjusted animal is abandoned and left to die, the human does exactly the same, but tries to justify it with facades and false statements about why we should not do it, when in reality it is done in a subtle and passive way. Christianity represents a false refuge, comforts and gives false hope to the miserable condition of life. This world is not for us.\n",
      "\n",
      "Personally I have failed and I have been discarded, in this life all I can experience is failure, alienation and pain. My mental abilities are weak. I am not strong, cunning, and much less attractive to my kind. Biologically there is no purpose that I can fulfill. I have stopped moving, if I ever moved forward. Nature has done with me what it should do. My mental faculties have been declining. In this state there is nothing I can experience other than suffering. And I am almost sure that there is no way out of this abyss. It is evident that something inside me no longer works or never worked. I never knew at what moment I began to descend into this deep abyss. Totally unable to modify it, my mind has become a place where desolation and hopelessness dominate in perpetuity. If I can find something to entertain myself it will always be for the benefit of those who are very well adapted to life's struggles. There are people who abandon their worth by giving up their servitude. I am one of those people. I am not able to conquer myself or my environment. There is nothing for me in this world.\n",

      "about 3 years ago now, i joined discord. My initial reason for it was to ask for help on how to install a mod for a game. During that time i also started feeling just really sad and things just didn't feel right anymore to the point where i started questioning myself if i should even be here anymore. And my go to was discord. No one knew who i was and there were plenty of people who were nice and seemed genuinely interested in trying to help people. so a few months passed, and with the help of some online friends i was able to slowly get better again. and then at one night it just hit me. there were hundereds, thousands of people who also feel like how i felt or even worse. that's when i actively started searching for people on discord who needed help. and it didn't take long before my dms were filled with people all around the world who also felt lost, who also felt scared just like how i felt. and after a year of trying my best to give people the best advice and trying to always be there for them, it just got too much for me and i kinda crashed. i fell back to the state i was in before all of this. it didn't take long for me to feel better again since my friends were there for me just every day to cheer me up and make my day worth living, and im so so greatful for that. and then we are where i am now. i still use discord to talk to my friends, and sometimes i still meet people that are in a really bad mental state, and most of the time it isn't even their own fault. 50% of the time it's their parents or just any third party that's just abusing them and making them feel like it just isn't worth staying here on earth anymore. \n",

      "suicide - I cannot save you.Every day is the same. If you can even split the days anymore. I spend 2-3 days awake at a time. What little medication induced sleep I can suffer through sprinkled throughout, like little pebbles in a huge field. But most of the time it's a solid nightmare. 45 minutes and you're awake again. Racked with sweat and fear, gripping your mind like a nut in a vise, slowly tightening. Light a cigarette, calm down. I can't. Just ignore it. I can't. Everything will be okay. No it won't. You don't live in the reality tangent that I do. You are all plugged into the matrix, living out your lives. Worried about bills, your children, you're worried about what these other people think of how you look, your clothes, your car, your social status. You don't know what true fear, anxiety, depression, angst, isolation and sadness are. \n",

I told him I could never do a long distance relationship as I'm just not strong enough for them, but after 2.5 years I was already to the point to where I just couldn't let go. I stuck it out for a year and a half - 2 years and would work a part time job and it got to the point to where every single day I had off I would drive out the two hours to see him, and sometimes even drive two hours back the same night just to see him for an hour or so a week. It was a bit rare that I didn't stay the night, there were times where I spent 3-4 days, sometimes even a week, but most of the time it was only 1-2 days at most.\n",

      "The problem is this dude is 29, and can't talk to his parents about anything. They're paying for everything- his apartment, his monthly allowance, his gas, they got him his car for free (his late grandmothers car) you name it. Now that's not saying he isn't capable of getting these things on his own, he's just been under his parents thumb from what I can assume his whole life- they aren't abusive or anything- but the relationship / marriage between his mother and father is honestly one of the worst ones I've ever seen that doesn't involve any sort of domestic violence. \n",
      "\n",
      "[ About his family-- skip ahead if you don't care too much-- His father is a lawyer with his own practice, but spends his money on literally everything he thinks is a good deal- I'm not supposed to tell anyone this but oh well: he ended up spending half a million dollars (I think ?) on a Yacht. A huuuuuuuuuge Yacht. That just sits at the dock in Florida. It didn't work when he bought it, it doesn't work now. It landed their family into a rather large amount of money issues / debt buying the thing, and now he has to pay docking fees every month. He provides for his entire family because his mother doesn't work and hasn't worked in over 20 years iirc. She just stays home and plays on her tablet all day and does laundry and cooking I believe. She's nice in person, but never really much cared for me.  Would never even allow me into her house when she hadn't even met me- even though I'd constantly drive out to see him and bring him goodies and things (he only lived about 30 minutes away) He has two brothers, one older: 32, and one younger: 27. The younger brother has high-mid functioning autism. Works at Little Ceasars- and then stays home and plays video games all day aside from doing little chores here and there. He's pretty darn cool, and although I've never seen it- I've heard can get pretty angry. His older brother is like the perfect specimen of Roid Rage. This dude is like Reptar on wheels- screams and cusses at his mom and shit- he went to medschool (what a surprise) and ended up losing his medical license or residency or something bad like that I think (not supposed to talk about that either so I'm just gunna leave it at that) so both of them live at home with the parents, but the older brother actually just got a residency in Arkansas or one of those states that starts with an \"A\" so I think he's moving out soon-I'm usually kept in the dark as far as his family matters- probably for the best. ]\n",

Every time we'd fight he'd just get up and leave or hang up on me and CONSTANTLY interrupt me. I can't even bring myself to tell someone they don't deserve me- it's not my right to say something like that... And I've had online friends (because they're easy to acquire with internet points !) tell me that he's no good for me, or that I need to leave him or I deserve better- but as soon as I would leave and find someone new he always came back. He always found a way to get me to come back, and I say that- but I've loved him more than I've loved anyone else before... and that's where I messed up I think.\n",

The worst he's ever done was lie to me about looking at local craigslist porn ads (,: - so I'm not 100% sure if he's cheated on me but I don't think he'd ever do that kind of stuff but he sure did go through a lot of local hook-up ads while my google chrome was still signed in............. \n",

He stopped at 42-- it was because I had 2 d's  on my report card.....which is bad yes I completely understand but.... maybe if the punishment would have been something else ? I don't know anymore... There was a time when I was 16 my dad drug me by my hair on the floor from my room to the livingroom (a good 15 ft I think) just because I stated that if he laid his hands on me I'd have to call the police... later that night when I was asleep he came into my room and sat on my bed crying... stroking my hair telling me that he was so sorry... I'd never not once laid a finger on my parents (okay I did once because my mom slapped me across the face so I slapped her across the face because after 16 years of this shit- but she knocked me on my ass so I learned my lesson) nor threatened them with anything other than my own safety. ^\n",

I never stayed out or hung out with any bad kids (my parents wouldn't let me go anywhere until they had met the other person's parents first- this was the rule all of my life even through senior year of highschool) So needless to say I didn't have many friends because no one my age wanted to get their parents to meet mine just so they could hang out with me.

While talking about this in front of our university, this gay guy we kind of know (but not really) overhears us and asks if he can join us. We agree because we didn't want to make him feel bad, even though he's been a pretty harsh guy to us (and me personally) in the past, by always complaining and pretending like everything around him is not up to his standards. \n",
      "\n",
      "So anyways, we go clubbing here and there we drink and keep on drinking. My good gay friend meets completely hot guy which I thought was cute too (but that's besides the point). Anyways, so after a time we notice that the person who came with us (let's call him Jack) was gone, however soon we saw him coming from the bar with free beer. He was dancing wildly spilling beer on people around him. At 3.15 AM we decided it was time to go to the train station to be able to catch the last train home (a ride of about 3 hours nonetheless). So we walk quickly on the sidewalk when we notice that Jack was walking on the street. We assumed he was too drunk and told him to get the fuck off of there, and took him with us on the sidewalk. This happened again, and this time a car hit him at low speed with its mirror. He wasn't hurt and the car was fine so we kept on speeding towards the train station. Our train was supposed to leave in 5 minutes when Jack tells us that he doesn't have a return ticket. So we fucking run to the ticket machine, but he didn't have any money, so we bought him a ticket. \n",
      "\n",
      "We got to the train and we sat together. Jack was quiet, but noticeably drunk so we told him he use his last 10 Euro on a cab home since he obviously was too drunk to walk. He argued that he would walk and everything would be fine. After a while he looks at me strange and asks me \"dude, can I like sleep at your place tonight?\" I told him that he could as long as he told me what was wrong, seeing as he was all weird and acting depressed. He said he couldn't say it, so I told him to write it to me in a text message. The text message said \"I'm afraid if i'll be alone i'll jump in front of a train.\" So I thought to myself \"Holy Shit, I can't handle this on my own... I can't take responsibility for his life!\"\n",
      " \n",
      "So then I told one of the two other friends to show me where the bathroom was. We got out of the cabin in which we were sitting and walked towards the toilet. I asked him what we should do and we agreed that it would be best to take him to my place to let him sleep off the alcohol. We settle on that and go back to our cabin. Jack was gone. The other friend sitting with him fell asleep. \n",
      "\n",
      "So we run through the train trying to find him until we pick him up pretty far away, with red and crying eyes. We take him back to our cabin but he just didn't pay attention anymore and kept on walking into things on purpose. We sat down with him and wanted to talk with him, to find out whats wrong. He said that he didn't have the time to explain it all and that he wanted to go to my place to sleep. One of my friends kept insisting that he should call anyone close to him, his mother, his brother, ANYONE, just so that we weren't alone in this (Jack is 18 btw). He refused to call his family an got quite angry at my other friends who were getting pissed off as well. Then insults started flying and he left the cabin. I followed him and sat down with him. I tried to talk some sense into him and kept on telling him things are gonna be alright, I just didn't know how to get him from the train station to my place yet. It was at this point where he started trusting me and distrusting the rest.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he sat back in the other cabin with the other two people and he started to say that nothing mattered and that nobody cared, etc. Here's where I saw alarm flags. I told him up front that I'm not a psychologist so if his suicide warnings are more than just drunken babbeling I will need to get him professional help (on saturday 3 AM). We asked him if he took any drugs because he looked worse and worse. He insisted that he didn't, but told us that he took 2 of his anti-depressants in the morning, which is more than 4 times his dosis apparently. I asked him why he was taking anti-depressants and he told me that he was taking medicine for acne, which had depression as a side effect, so that's why he took the anti depressants. We all thought \"Oh shit he's ODing or some shit on those pills and the alcohol\" so we told him we were gonna take  him to the hospital. All of the sudden he started crying and laughing at the same time and said something like \"WHO'S SCREAMING? WHY IS THERE A WOMAN SCREAMING?\" But the reality was there was no screaming. He kept on telling us he heard a voice like a horror movie. We were now very close to our station, so we took him out. By this time, I had to take him between my arms to guide him while walking and to prevent him falling off the escalator. He was crying and babbeling. At that point it dawned to me, that he drank out of a glass that wasn't his, so he might have some hallucinations from an LSD spiked drink or some shit. \n",
      "\n",
      "So we threw him into a cab in which he kept on crying and babbelling and went to the hospital. All of the sudden he just stops. His eyes closed, he stops talking, I don't know if he stopped breathing, but I remember thinking \"fuck he's dead\". Soon he opened his eyes again though, however it was scary.\n",
      "\n",
      "So we got him into the hospital and all of the sudden he tells everyone this story that he accepted a drink from an older man which tasted strange, and that the man just kept smiling at him. To me however that sounded like total bullshit since he said it so last minute. \n",
      "\n",
      "They put him in a hospital bed, listened to the story you just read and gave him an alcohol test. They didn't do anything about the voices though and will keep him in the hospital til today in the evening. \n",
      "\n",
      "I was the last one to see him and he told me \"I have a feeling that they're gonna make the screaming go away *but I'll still feel like throwing myself in front of a bus tomorrow*.\" I told him that this is something he needs to talk over with a psychiatrist that was gonna evaluate him tomorrow, because I don't know how to give the right advice if he feels that way.\n",
      "\n",
      "So now that I've told this story, here is my concern: After helping the dude out with all this stuff, I don't want to become his mommy. I know it sounds selfish, but he uses every opportunity he gets to somehow insult me. He doesn't really have friends, so what am I gonna do? I feel like I'm part of this whole big thing, even though I barely know the guy and don't really like him? My other two friends don't care but I feel trapped, in the sense that *if I don't continually help him, he will kill himself, and it will be my fault*. \n",
      "\n",
      "BTW, we told the hospital people that he thought of killing himself. \n",
      "\n",
      "Also was putting him into a hospital the best idea, or should he just slept over? \n",
      "\n",
      "Help? :( \n",
      "\n",
      "Oh yeah, we're not in the US, so US laws don't apply.\n",

      "suicide - Why even?I'm very nihilistic and pessimistic about life. I'm been having these thoughts since 5 years back. It all started when I didn't have many friends and was bullied like every other kid in my age. I became a porn addict and sadly it escalated over the years and I craved more and I'm so sickened by it I want to end it. Anyways I recently went out a very dark phase. I moved town to study at university and I ended up sleeping all day and watching porn in the nights and not going on the lectures. I ended up moving home and got a job and my first serious relationship. Everything seems like it's going fine but I still have these suicidal thoughts everyday. How to find meaning in life?\n",

I tried talking to my girlfriend, but everytime I try talking to her it ends up becoming a terrible argument. I'm in a really bad place and I tend to be more direct when talking to people when I am like that. But she says I'm being rude and that she doesn't deserve to be treated that way, she has already a lot on her plate and her own problems. I don't understand what way I'm treating her that is so negative. I don't know how to communicate with her without her getting mad at me or sad. I really don't know what to do anymore and I don't have anyone else. I just want this pain to go away, this agony. I haven't stopped crying for 3 days now and tomorrow I have to go to university and I don't know how I'm going to make it. My masters is draining me. My advisors are literally just that on a paper, they overlooked a small mistake I (and 2 other students!) made that made me lose a whole year of work, just like that. I am literally racing against time now and I am just having a really bad time dealing with this. I can't focus. I've been on zoloft for over a month now and it hasn't really helped much. And the longer I take to be productive, the more anxious I get and eventually depressed. I am utterly useless. I am so tired of everything, I just wanted a break, you know? Something to break through the agony. Both. I can't deal with all of it anymore. I'm tired of the discussions, of the anxiety, of having to live with my parents in order to finish my fucking masters. My parents who find every little thing to complain about me and my father, who is always always right and completely unable to deal with anger.

      "First, off I am old as far as the internet is concerned. I lived my life in seclusion and mostly alone. However, it is not by choice. I have tried many times to make friends both in real life or online with both options failing miserably. I will go over this later. I simply continue living for whatever reason most likely because I always feel too weak-willed to actually commit suicide.  So to start, I do not do anything I just go through the motions. I wake up, brush my teeth, take a shower, go to work, work out during my lunch break (to pretend I have any self worth), go home at 1600, distract myself from the crushing realization that I am alone, eat dinner, continue distracting myself, try not to cry or cut myself, do it anyway sometimes (I am good at hiding it in my old age so at least no one will ever see it anyway.) go to sleep and repeat. Basically this is my weekdays, on weekends it's the same minus the work and occasionally I go practice fencing/kendo but it seems recently all my fellow fighters refuse to spar me or are trying to distance themselves from me. So back to the friends thing, I have tried many times to go to bars, Social gatherings, comic shops, conventions, etc. but I am too socially awkward I suppose. Most people my age have all the friends they want it seems and the younger people think I'm just that weird guy (at least that's my assumption). I turned to online games thinking other people who are borderline Hikikomori, like me, would be more understanding and want to talk and be friends. I was of course wrong, I am fairly good at videogames I guess I just have a lot of practice but it seems people don't want to be friends at all just play the game. That's cool tho i thought wrong I suppose. Occasionally I do however in real life find someone who wants to be friends with me, whether their motives are pure or not or they want to use me for money or something I do not know. Perhaps they just pity me, in any case those are the moments when I am happy, they want to spend a lot of time with me and I hang out as much as possible but then something always goes wrong. Either they get what they were after or they just start ghosting me out of nowhere. I am unsure why this happens, but every time it does, I feel a little deader inside. \n",
      "\n",
      "In any case, I am not an attractive person by a lot of peoples standards, and when I do find someone to share a relationship with they have cheated on me or used me for financial support only. I suppose most of my problems stem from being alone. No friends, no nearby family, no pets, just the void. In the end I go through the motions of living, and all that I do is survive.\n",

My life is over. I'm not going to go to community college, be a virgin and work at a McDonald's, especially after the hell I've been through enough in my life. I don't even know how I lived through so much, taking care of a disabled father, doing homework without anyone's help, and yet, here I am. Still breathing. Alive. I think will power keeps me alive.

I have loving parents, I'm attending medical school, according to some standards I've hit the lottery of life. Well, I'll be completely honest and tell you that I feel like I drew the short end of the stick. Everyday I feel like a failure, I feel miserable being surrounded by people I dislike, I am tired of living in a perpetual state of anxiety and panic and cramming my head with hundreds of pages of information on a weekly basis and probably for life. \"Do something you enjoy\" Do people even understand that depression makes you unable to enjoy things you used to enjoy? \"Then take some time off school or drop out of medical school altogether\" I already tried taking some time away from academia, they were the worst two years of my life. Believe me, if I drop out of medical school, I will default to a NEET. If I had lots of money, I would've dropped out already. But my parents will need me when they grow old because they don't have stable jobs. So I need to become a successful member of society to make them proud and pay them back for all the bullshit they've went through just to raise me. But at the same time I wish I could just switch my brain off and stop having to worry about 10000 things at the same time. I'm a solidified mass of depression, anxiety, panic, regret, and stress.\n",

      "suicide - It was not obvious at first but everyone I loved, cared, friends, relationships have left me.It is time for me to check in I guess. It has been years since I’m over addiction and hardcore depression but recently I started thinking of doing it again as I have made terrible choices and some mistakes that I don’t even know what they are as I’m not being told but at first a couple not really close friends stopped talking with me in groups I asked them for a while and got no reply and later I heard they do not want me anymore and this was after a terrible breakup with a person I loved the most and probably hurt the most during breakup, anyway. Later I wasn’t in any groups, nobody was messaging me and I started talking with them but most people had no interest or was just trying to get done with it. And later one my closes friends since childhood openly stated he is not talking to me anymore and said he will never say why and I shouldn’t ask. I made new friends but can’t trust and even the new ones I made was there for my past or current successes or looks or whatever and when they were done, they just left. I literally have nobody to talk to and I even hate looking for a friend or someone offering out of pity as it feels extremely condescending. I am willing to do all the hard work, years of work, at the pace it needed to be, but for most I don’t even know why they don’t see me fit anymore as I was once adored. For the ones I know the reason even if I did everything they see as right for them even on my deathbed I know I would never hear let’s say my ex, the person I was with longest, loved immensely, profoundly, with my everything, I wouldn’t be forgiven. I hate myself and I have nobody to listen how I hate myself. I will keep on moving forward better learned from my mistakes and never repeat, I know but when something good comes to me there is always an expiration date I can see but ignore. If I dropped dead, nobody would even know anymore. I want to feel loved again and I am sober 2+ years but God is it tempting. Like you give them everything and assure mutuality and those friends you had for years with a mistake or even with nothing as I do not know just disappear, live happily and leave you fucked up. Being Bipolar, an ex-Addict and having ADHD doesn’t help either. I don’t think I can ever trust anymore. I love though, everyone, everything. They just don’t return.\n",

      "non-suicide - My story. I have had a rough time throughout my life and I wanted to discuss it with people like me. I like a lot of you suffer from depression and other mental health issues. I am a bright person and I normally talk to adults because it is so hard to find friends who are like me. Part of the reason why it's so hard to find friends is how much I want to learn and (I am not trying to brag or anything) my intelligence. I want to learn and normally when I talk to an adult they say “your going places kid” or something like that. So I can’t stand kids who don’t want to learn and who don't mess around constantly in class. But I also want to be happy and have friends. I was bullied at my first school ,but the pace of things was right for me, sort of. The issue was I have a condition called dysgraphia. Dysgraphia is a motoring issue where your motor skills aren’t very good and you can’t write fast or actually . Combined with ADHD (which I also have) you get a nasty combo. You have someone who has ideas. And they want to write to them and draw them etc. But they can’t because of their motoring issues. One solution we came up with was to use and iPad to type my work. That combined with a lot of hard work to catch up and get on track. I was excelling. But then everyone bullied be for being different and complained that I got to use the iPad. They also got mad because they saw I was succeeding when using it. I worked extremely hard to get back on track, and I am proud that, but I was bullied for it. The next school I went to was meant to be for kids like me. Not necessarily kids who wanted to learn but kids with “learning differences”. This school was slow but the administration cared and I was doing great for about a year. Then it hit the fan and the school changed. It basically started excepting kids for the money to pay off its debt (it was a private school). The kids they admitted were terrible and extremely hard to learn with. I couldn’t focus and I wanted to learn but couldn’t. Every time I came to the head of the school they just didn’t care about me. I powered through and going into freshman year (this year) I was back at square one for the second time. No friends and a new school. So far this year has been a very mixed bag. I have met kids like me who want to learn, and I was ecstatic about that. But a new issue came up like always. The issue now is that the school isn’t challenging, and again I want to learn and other people are stopping me. I feel powerless because I have been working so hard throughout the years working on my depression and mental health. My ADHD and dysgraphia, but people aren’t allowing me to succeed. I also want to say that just because someone is wealthy and have parents who care about them doesn’t mean they don’t have problems too.\n",
      "suicide - Unsure if anyone can relate to this.I feel like I'm not even a person anymore. I've been in a dead end in life for about 5 years now. I have a circle of people who say they care about me. But it only makes my problems worse. I feel like i have no personality what so ever. I have no real passions. No drive. No inspiration to make anything out of my life. The only thing that's kept me going so far is the people who \"care\" about me. The only shred of humanity and emotion i feel is a crippling fear that I'll let everybody i know down. And that I'll just dissapoint them. I work a job that i hate. And i can't leave because i don't wanna let them down. I have a house filled with roomates. Who i depend on for survival. And i know that if i stopped working. Or if i disappeared I'd let them down. I have no family left except for my little sister. Who i don't want to show any weakness too. Because i don't wanna let her down. I don't think I've been happy for a very long time. I feel like i want to be happy. But i can't find anything or anyone that makes me feel happy. My hobbies are just things i do that i felt used to make me feel happy. But don't give me any joy anymore. And everytime i say \"I'll just try doing this\" i either give up or never start in the first place. I don't know what to do anymore really. I feel trapped. And i feep scared. I don't wanna let the people i care about down. But i can't be happy no matter what i do. All i think about is how other people have less. And it's selfish of me to keep on thinking these things when i have people who depend on me. And most of the time it's easy to suppress these feelings. But every now and again all these thoughts start flooding back to me. I'm letting people down i need to try harder. If i stop now everything ive done up to this point will be for nothing. I'd let everyone down. And i don't want to do that. But the pressure keeps building and i don't know how to stop it. Everytime i try to reach out about this stuff. I can never get the right words out. And i don't want other people to worry about me. I'm in this fucked up place where im too scared to take a step forward. To scared to take a step back.

She was bottling things up and putting up a facade of normality whenever I came to visit. I made it clear when I first visited her in hospital that I wanted her to be open with us and with her psychiatrist; that all I wanted was to see her get better and pretending things were normal didn't make me or her feel the slightest bit better. I also made sure that my dad was much more involved in the recovery process: getting an emergency phone, talking regularly with the psychiatrist, etc (although I think the hospital was going to arrange that anyway).

I can sometimes feel a sweet \"nothing\"  and im out of my body , followed by feeling only anxiety or just generally negative. I feel like a bitch for wishing my depression was worse, but I just wish I had no motivation so that people would really care, or so that I would \"need\" antidepressants. Anyway, I partially look forward to things that might make me happy, and then partially wanna kill myself everyday.  It's not like I have the worst problems in the world, but I hate the fact that I can laugh my ass off over anything ever, but then not actually feel anything, or just be sad while I do it. It eooukd just be nice to talk to people who dont get tired of listening.\n",

He just can’t handle my shit anymore and needs to move on with his life, finishing graduate school and already landed a well paying job and shit I wish him the best. It only makes me feel more worthless. He broke up with me on the 1st of August and gave me till the end of the month to find a place to stay and get all of my stuff.

I eventually tried to recontact her and once he took her back she turned into the worst person I've ever met. She started to belittle me and call me all sorts of names.

As of the moment I just cried next to her (first time she saw me cry) I just felt like a horrible boyfriend, I didn’t tell her to stop hanging out with him at that point with I should have. I just thought if I lose her it’s probably my fault. A few days later I told her to stop hanging out with him. She got a little upset about it. Then a few weeks later I found out that one that day she was gonna break up with me but she didn’t Because she didn’t know what I would do.

      "suicide - I'm just so done. I'm over it. I'm tiredI weigh 500lbs.  I'm nearly 30yo.  My husband only loves me half the time.  Our home is a trashed mess with barely any room to walk.  There's a leak in the ceiling of the living room and I'm pretty sure we've got black mold.  I have OCD, severe anxiety, and severe depression.  My life is fear, disturbing thoughts I can't get rid of, and a lack of enthusiasm for all of the things I loved once upon a time.  Sure, I could try and lose the weight but  literally doing anything hurts and is unbelievably difficult.  I can't stand for very long with my legs cramping or my back seizing up.  Why even bother losing the weight at this point?  My body is already ruined.  Why bother continuing on at all?  I'm lazy, unmotivated, and disgusting.  I hate myself.  I hate my life.  I actually have a decent job but I hate going there.  Being around other people is terrible because I have to pretend I'm happy and I know every one is constantly judging me.  And before anyone suggests it, therapy and medication are out of the question.  We can't afford the doctor or a therapist or anything like that.  I live in the US.  Healthcare is insanely expensive and the services that are available for free are either wait listed like crazy or of such a low quality that it's not worth bothering with them at all.\n",

I immediately confronted her about it, and she opened up because we were quite close at that point, but wouldn’t really tell me why she was self harming. Over the weeks, when we had exams/finals, she got much worse - she started cutting much more frequently, on her arms, legs, chest etc. Skipping classes one day, she was caught and sent to the Vice Principals office where she told him about her self harming as an excuse (mistake). After getting sent to the counsellors office, her mum was called to school to pick her up.\n",

Even years later, she’s still afraid of her brother, and only talks with him when absolutely necessary. \n",

There was no place to escape to either, as she shared a room with her mother and hid in the bathroom to self harm. An incident happened just two weeks ago: her father, mother and older brother had left the house earlier in the day which left her alone to roam and relax freely. When she felt a little hungry, she left her room to get food and was ambushed by her mother who was waiting hidden in another room, thinking she had caught her self harming. This was later followed by her father breaking down the door when she made a makeshift lock. (the lock was the barrel bolt type, and the bolt had been removed). She was forced to wait until either her brother or father came home, so she was sure she was safer. Her mother has been really invasive with her privacy and often did this, as well as going through her belongings whenever she isn’t at home.\n",

That means that they can multiply easily. Soon, the world will be overpopulated with these jellyfish. After they take over the oceans, they would want to expand and colonize land. Due to them being able to live basically forever, they have more time to expand their intelligence. We need to stop this while we can. I say pollute be ocean to kill these fuckers off.\n",

The thing is i have been fighting this for about 3 years now, expecting things to get better but they haven't. My father is abusive verbally and sometimes physically. My parent are together however he abuses my mom verbally as well. The reason that i fell suicidal is because of him mostly. I cant handle all his shit that he throws and all the pain he causes. One time he woke up up in the middle of the night and just started beating me because apparently i broke something of his. Then he kicked me out so i left but after a week i was welcomed back home. He views me as a disappointment and has said so because i didn't get into a good college and am going to a community college. He makes good money but refuses to pay for my education. The reason that i haven't killed myself yet is because i don't want to leave my mom alone with my sister. I can barely sleep at night and because of him when i do sleep my dreams are plagued with me fighting my father all the time. I have such hate for him and everything he does but i was raised not to strike out at my father or fight him. I don't know what i should do because i think ill start going insane if i keep on feeling such hate for him and will eventually be driven to kill him, but that isn't something i want to do. So naturally the only thing is for me to commit suicide and get rid of this burden and his constant pestering. Sure i have friends and i talk to them alot but ever since i fought with my best friend because he backstabbed me i couldn't get over it. I realized that all these...friends are just people we just value them more and i cant count on them because people care for themselves mostly. I get decent grades at school mostly a's and b's but i dont apply myself enough cause i have no motivation to complete school. To be honest i didnt even see myself going to college because i didnt think i would live this long. Anyways thats enough about me.\n",

My second therapist was slightly better, but she always wanted to find the reason i'm depressed and anxious rather than trying to solve my problems. I've been seeing her for months when i got into a hospital for self harming, and after that it happened a few more times. In April, i had the realization. You know, when everything just starts to make sense and you put it all together and you're like...ah. I told my therapist i was transgender. I started looking more into this all and i realized what i felt all my childhood and why i just...knew something was wrong as a turned 13 and started female puberty was, gender dysphoria.

      "suicide - Suicide is the Obvious ChoiceI want to commit suicide because I am ultimately lonely and bored. If I don't kill myself I am afraid that I will harm others or live with this pain until I die alone and insane. Years after recognizing my depression, I've concluded that my problem is not with finding worth in myself as much as in the world around me. \n",
      " \n",
      "Unless I'm working on something, its like my mind is dry and my brain is itching. Being around most people for longer than an hour at a time is like being starved and having to run cross-country. The only two friends I have are rare folk but even among them I feel like I'm trying to communicate with aliens. Romantic companionship is out of the question. My last girlfriend broke up with me for religious reasons, and it wasn't until I spiraled further into depression that I realized that for however intelligent or special for a girl she was, I would likely never find romance without finding my partner to just be a daily dose of oxytocin. \n",

My hobbies change monthly, one day I will be starting an ambitious software project and days later, thousands of lines of code into a program I will be frustrated and delete everything. I wrote a bunch of music, started recording it, then suddenly the passion is gone and I'm seeking something else. I could go on about this pattern for about 4 years worth of activities. I experimented with cutting recently to no avail. I've had 2 visual hallucinations and have had one occasion of hearing voices in the last two months. My mind is trapped in my body and I feel like I am watching a bad movie that has lost its novelty, and I want to turn it off. Sometimes I believe that I'm being observed in a behavioral experiment. I want to tell people about these feelings but I'm worried about the repercussions and the loss of personal freedoms I might have that goes with such a disclosure.  \n",

I figure twitch is a good way for people to show up and ask questions without needing to sign up and lose their anonymity. I am a neuroscience major with a minor in astronomy.

Jump on twitch and ask a question in the chat, or follow the link to my discord in case you need to post a picture of a problem etc. There are no stupid questions.

Her straight blonde hair is shoulder length and perfectly cut, her face completely symmetrical and she doesn’t even blink. I decide she must be CGI because she’s so perfect. But her voice is more noticeably unnatural. She speaks in a monotone voice and her words are choppy. Not as obvious as Google Translate but still flawed. What she’s speaking about is even stranger: she’s saying there is no hope, we are all doomed and we should’ve obeyed. Obeyed what? I try change the channel. She's still there. I try again. She’s still there. I turn it off and on again. She’s still there. Hackers? I wonder where Gwaine is. He’ll be hungry. I thought he’d be barking his head off by now.

I gag and force it down. “And here, take this.”, she hands me a black waterproof jacket, I take it gratefully.

      "non-suicide - I'm at the lowest point in my life so far and I need help. Last night started of pretty normal until my stepdad goes to bed. At that point me, my brother, and my baby brother, (who is my stepdad's kid), are just trying to have fun which is kind of hard for me because I'm diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I pick up a Nerf gun which my brother hasn't touched in months and just mess around with it. My brother sees me with it and grabs it away from me. I pick up the other one which is just sitting and my baby brother who is to picks up another one, (keep in mind we're just playing at this point), my brother once again starts trying to choke me and he grabs the gun again. At this point I think we're still \"playing\" so I give my 2 year old baby brother a plastic malet with rubber ends filled with air and just say, \"Go get those guns from him.\" My stepdad then runs down from the     bathroom and starts screaming at me and tells me to go to my room. I do and then my mom screams for me to bring up the Xbox. I'd do that then five minutes later she storms down and I'm pretty sure she threw away my Oculus Quest which I paid most of the money for. While she came down for that she slapped me multiple times on the back of the head. She then goes back upstairs and storms back down and starts shaking me and and started saying she was going to have to get another divorce and saying it was all my fault. After that I seriously considered suicide, I had my knife and started pushing but I just couldn't go on with it.

      "At the beginning of the year I dropped out of school because the industry I was working on had an incredibly sexist environment that made it difficult for me to feel enthused about my career or even come to school. Between the sexual harassment and being put down by my peers, I had to get out of there. So I left, and applied to art school because I've always enjoyed doing art and people tell me I'm good at it. I got in to one of the top-ranked art schools and will be starting there in the fall. But I don't want to go anymore. It's incredibly expensive, and since I am an orphan (mom cut contact, dad passed away) I have no financial support. I also think art school is kind of stupid now. Of course you can improve as an artist, but you have to be born a truly great artist. It can't be taught. And I wasn't born a great artist. Art doesn't make me happy anymore. Nothing else does though, and I'm too stupid to really do anything else. It hurts me to admit it but sometimes I even struggle with basic multiplication, so there's no way I could pass a math class. People always say I'll find something I like when I get there, but it's an ART school. All they teach is art. And people also say \"you're young! you can try whatever you want to do!\" but that costs money, and financially I am running out of time. \n",

I have supportive friends and I am in a much safer place than I was, but I suffer from a crippling mood disorder that makes everything feel like a chore/completely impossible - and this is no exaggeration. Often I will wake up, force myself to eat breakfast, shower, and then go back to bed, sometimes for the rest of the day. This is typical of an average day for me. A bad one sees me do nothing but stay in bed all day and sleep for 15 hrs+.\n",

Call me picky, but if it was a choice between being half-awake for the rest of my life or having an early finish, I'd choose the latter.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have interests and hobbies, people and things that I care about, and things I would like to achieve but I regularly have weeks or months of inability to care for myself which means I'm not capable of maintaining relationships, work or study. This leaves me in a place where I can't make goals or plans, and if I do make any they go along with the likely risk of having to cancel them which hits me hard. I don't think about the future because I have been caught like this for 11 years with my internal situation getting steadily worse - so from my perspective, it looks rather bleak.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I am well enough, I eat quite healthily, exercise regularly and try to maintain contact with friends. This often works well for some time, however, the inevitable decline happens. I have tried pushing through this downward slide, but this only delays and worsens the depression. I have also tried letting myself do what I need/feel, but this also ends up with me in the same place, only sooner. I struggle with the knowing that at my best I am a very capable individual, but that for the most part I have very little functional capacity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The core of the issue is that I don't want to be alive, and so I force myself to adopt a more merry outlook. This leaves me disconnected from and at odds to my emotional experiences, which no doubt adds to my depression. The problem is that if I were to let myself feel how I truly feel, I wouldn't have survived this long, and even if I did I would have shut myself off from the world completely. So, from my perspective it seems like a choice between being utterly and hopelessly depressed or ignoring how I feel and doing what I can before I end up feeling utterly and hopelessly depressed until I can force myself to ignore it again.\n",

I know this sounds pretty lame, and in a way it is, but it's incredibly frustrating to have to constantly dumb yourself down to get a therapist to understand you, to have to be constantly on edge because the therapist is coercive and manipulative, or because their position is in contradiction to your values and beliefs. And it's hard enough to get out of bed, let alone to meet a complete stranger to go over details of horrible and traumatic past experiences over numerous appointments just to establish that the therapist is not a good fit for me and that I need to try and find a new one.\n",

      "suicide - Could my purpose in life be to die?Hello just some background info on me I am an 18 year old female. I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder as well as generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder years ago. I have been in and out of treatment and have spent months in partial hospitalization as well as one inpatient stay. I have tried every treatment, medication, and type of therapy and none have helped. My psychiatrist said there is nothing else she can do to help me a year ago. I have continued to try to get better but it seems as though I am just destined to fail. I applied to colleges and got accepted to some very good schools, but rejected from my top choice. Due to my health I am unable to live a normal life and miss a lot of school. I don't remember the last time I was happy. Every time I am trying to get better something happens that deters me. I do not want to get into detail because there have been so many things that have gone wrong. My sister and my family suffer so much watching me be sick. They have been suffering for years and my mom constantly cries and asks how it's possible that I still haven't gotten better. I can not bear to see them in pain. I always believed that my purpose in life was to be a doctor and help others. However, there seem to be endless obstacles that continue to arise and prevent me from reaching my goal, despite me truly trying as hard as I can to overcome them. I have put all of my energy into getting my life back on track and I have stayed the same if not worse. It occurred to me that maybe my true purpose is not to help others but to die. Maybe my suicide will help someone else in some way. My family will not have to watch me suffer and perhaps then my younger sister will be able to live a normal and happy life. I can already tell I am beginning to cause her problems and I don't want her to grow up suffering as I do. Maybe without me my parents and sister will continue to be a happy family as they were before I got sick. My family is amazing and they have no issues except me. Could it be possible that my true purpose in life is to commit suicide? Please do not tell me to see a therapist or doctor because I have been seeing them for years and have tried every available medication and have seen over 5 psychiatrists and 15 therapists. \n",

It seems that all avenues of escape have been denied: unemployment, veterans benefits, fuck I can't even get food stamps because I'm trying to get an education to get a shit job with a shit degree.

Oh yeah, the I denied Captain's Mast there and demanded a Courts Martial because at least in a courts martial you get the chance to defend yourself and I was on a shore command, so I had the opportunity to do so.

I mean fuck, I can't even afford gas or food or even rent. I can't even take out enough student loans to cover the cost of living, much less a comfortable living. Besides, where I live now, there isn't even the promise of completing a degree that would even make me marketable in this job market.

My friends has slowly dwindled down into nothing, with most of my relationships being broken due to me being a generally unhappy person. Nobody wants to hang around with that person.

      "suicide - Too pure for this world?Hello reddit. I like to put out there that there are many reasons I still have suicidal ideation. I used to want to be nice to everyone and thought life was good. But after some backstabs, not knowing how to deal with vain and difficult people,friendships growing more distant, never knew how to stand up to bullies or people who take advantage of you, developing trust issues, I grow more desensitized, less compassionate, more stressed/careful about people,feel sadistic when esp bad people suffer, and more cynical. I'm also shy introvert but can talk to some people depending. I don't have any close friends(which I perceive could still make time to talk to you even if they have a long day of work) and partner. I feel I probably turn more of a blind eye to animals who need help in front of me because I am too concerned about myself or don't care much. Also it seems in this world, you can't be yourself, especially at work, such as being strictly professional and not suffer wrath of mean bosses if possible. Moreover, it seems I have to be in part of \"white lies\", which I felt touched my moral nerve, to get into nursing school and do well on interviews and \"wear a mask\" if go to work as a nurse. FYI I am not nurse but currently am in college.(and I may end up not like nursing after I tried nursing school and jobs i guess) Although I still want a good house, stable income, be independent from parents, and have enough money to do side projects, I feel I can't live with values. Such as working at a workplace that is true to itself and filled with compassionate and fair people. I used to look up to law enforcement, medical field, school systems, law, and government,etc. However, when I look around those places and other work, there always seems to be corruption and suffering.(ie. bully victims being punished rather than bullies for fighting back, police just frame innocent people, arrogant doctors harass and act condescending towards nurses, us people somehow allowed some president to allow covid situation to worsen and many people suffer the consequences with the virus). Also, I know I am not creatively minded and great problem solving person to be appealed to demanding different jobs out there nowadays. I often felt uncorfortable to be part of jobs or companies(i guess that's like pretty much everywhere) that has corruption within that I cannot help deal with and just help instead to continue their existence. I feel if I continue living I feel I am one of many people out that contribute to the worsening of the environment like driving cars(make ozone layer worse). And also I feel some guilt that I survive and ignore people who seem to suffer non-stop depression,suicidal, and hopelessness because I don't exactly know how to help them effectively and feel I may drain my own energy. I also wonder if people who committed suicide were always destined to never have their mortal lives saved. I did see some therapists but I can't still resolve my being too pure thoughts. If I were a theist, I would not want to be with a God that restricts freedom unreasonably, be contractidictory between what's out there and what's in \"holy document(s)\", allows evil and corruption to spread on earth,(and people's lives continued to be obliterated), and somehow created someone like me to suffer due to having a curious mind and being knowledgeable and uncertain. Does anyone feel like they are too pure for this world and rather kill themselves and not be corrupted? What ways, if any, do you deal with these being too pure feelings and still live? Is there no hope for pure hearted people to live in this world even anymore? Also any advice for my own case?\n",

Happens anyways. I really don't wanna die, but I think it's better than living this way and being a burden to my family and few friends I still have. I'll never be successful. I've always been focused on staying afloat rather than moving forward because it was exhausting enough to try to keep myself calm enough to go about my life. I graduated high school and that's about the only accomplishment I've ever had. And the only reason I did that is because if I didn't I wouldn't have had a place to live. Same reason I force myself to go to work. But that's gonna end soon too. The boss is starting to notice I can't handle it. And I really don't say much about it, it's just obvious I'm a mess all the time. Everyone in my life has done a really great job of supporting me, but they shouldn't have to. I'm not gonna get better.. there's no point to it honestly. I don't want sympathy or anything, I just felt like I had to tell someone about it.

Or trying to make me kill myself. I am too depressed. Sometimes cant even sleep. She got a tablet from school. She watches retarded things on youtube everytime my mom isn't looking. I never play on my ps4 if its not weekend or I didn't finish homeworks. Mom doesn't punish her at all, anything she does, but today I went and bought a paysafecard or some shit to get psplus to download need for speed payback and play gta with friends and saw that I can't buy the 1 month psplus. She got mad even if I can just put more money and get 3 months of psplus and now she doesn't let me use the ps4, but also took my sister's tablet. After watching countless videos on youtube. There is a lot more that she does, almost anyone would already kill himself. I am living now just for my grandparents and because I want to kill my sister before dying. Mom cares more about my grades and school than my mental state. I became crazy. My mom always told me that my dad is a liar and hides a lot of things. I am starting to think that it's the opposite. My sister is a demon, not a human she will do anything to destroy me. Now I will live only to destroy her. Show everyone who she really is If I succeed to destroy her life, I will probably either kill myself, either see if my life becomes better. No, this is not for r/siblingsfromhell, this is way worse.

I don’t know why I won’t do it right away, even though I believe nothing actually matters especially when you’re dead. I also don’t know whether I should continue to study and work until I actually commit the act.  Suddenly there are so many technical questions, almost taking the pleasure out of my decision. I also feel like I’m beginning to depersonalize and to feel sad for myself, a human being that will soon be dead.

      "suicide - My short experience on this sub.I started checking in on this sub about a week or so ago and I just wanted to say that despite not know who the fuck any of you are I genuinely appreciate you all for even talking on here. Hell I've got some tears already just writing this. To be blunt I've tried to kill myself at least 4-6 times in my life since I was 12 and this month I've tried twice. And now my online best friend has spiraled into a deep depression, cut communications with everyone, and may possibly be at risk of suicide as well. So yeah life for me isn't fucking fun especially this holiday season. But being here is always eye opening and sadly also soul crushing. But I think the fact that we're all here feeling essentially the same way about ourselves says so much about us as people. For me I understand that I am living with depression and anxiety and as far as I know everyone of us here is too. I feel like hope isn't even a part of my life. I'm jobless currently due to a mental breakdown that caused me to drop out of college. I'm out of shape. I've been mostly isolated from the world these past 3-4 months. Essentially I've been given a bad set of cards. Shit, we all have. I hope all of us could be able to find peace and love within ourselves and others. I feel like coming here helps me understand that we all can try our best to make life better and easier for ourselves. Even if we stay alive for all the stupid small things we love at least we have a reason to exist in this life. I know now I'm just ranting and maybe making no damn sense now. There's probably not even a clear point to why I type this. To be honest, currently at this exact moment I can easily say I'm at my lowest point. I write this really to let it all out. Sure maybe this is meaningless. Sure maybe life is meaningless. Or hell, maybe I'm meaningless. But maybe we just need to make something matter instead of waiting for a person or thing to save us. I'm sure we all keep going on because we believe some good will come our way. I hope that's the case. Apologies if this wall of text is too much and senseless. Thank you if you bother reading this mild sob story. And godspeed to all of you here and I only wish you all the best that life has to offer.\n",

      "2. I have zero friends in real life. \n",
      "3. I've spent the last seven years compulsively exercising, to the point of rubbing my skin raw until it bleeds and bruises (my back). I do this all day and everyday and it totally eclipses everything in my life. \n",
      "4. I only leave the house once a week if I'm lucky, for a few hours. This is because despite almost being 22, I just recently got my license because I was actively held back by a narcissist who is very threatened by my attempts at independence. \n",
      "5. I've been severely mentally ill for years with little to no assistance. And my OCD is at the point where it could probably look almost look like  psychosis in certain moments \n",
      "6. I have spent the last 7 years severely dissociated and I can't figure out a way to stop. My hearing literally gets cut off when I'm around people, and I can feel my skin go numb. Circumstances like this makes it impossible to want to be around people, even if I had the opportunity to. \n",
      "7. I have become a completely nasty and embittering person, and I'm constantly angry at my myself and other people. This creates a feedback loop in my mind and the guilt is an absolute savage. It's very tightly tied to my OCD which is a lot about morality. \n",
      "8. My gender dysphoria from childhood is back!!! I had severe dysphoria in childhood that seemed to disappear for many years. This is too long and complicated to get into, but the rage and envy I feel about not being born male is out of this fucking world folks. My dysphoria is largely tied to my sexuality and in some ways I don't completely trust it and have many ways of interpreting it. But it's getting ugly. No doubt my OCD has attached itself onto constantly contemplating the very nature of what a gender identity is in the first place. \n",
      "9. I have no stable support to reach out to in dealing with any of this. And even if I manage to pull off getting support from my parents (the money isn't really there) it's going to come at a huge price of constant guilting and shaming. \n",
      "10. I was and continue to be abused by my mother who is, as I've said, a narcissist. She has no understanding of boundaries or how to behave appropriately in relationships and has the mentality of a 3 year old. After she financially abusing my father, leaving us in ruins and debt, my father has packed on probably 60 pounds. And he was already heavy. He's basically my only thread to life and only with his support can I have any hope of gaining independence. But he's in his mid 50s and definitely on his way to a heart attack now. He refuses to go to the doctor even when I've offered to call and make the appointment and even go with him. He's got social anxiety so I thought that might help, but to no avail. \n",
      "11. I'm not intelligent enough to make it through college if I can even manage to get my foot back in the door.

I don't know what to do, it seems hopeless. I have to go back to school tomorrow after a 3 month school break. (Not that I attended school before that) I can't stand seeing my classmates again, I despise most of them. My hands shake when I think about school and all the assignments, considering I'm a dumb fuck who can't even do basic maths and write a simple essay. I feel helpless. I live in a small house with my 2 little sisters and an overprotective mother, and I don't get any privacy, at all. I feel it (privacy) is very important to my well-being.

Being an average student in India is being a liability to your family. I didn't have such bad performances before, until last 3 years. I hastily took Science( Maths and Engineering) after 10th grade to avoid spending huge amount of money for tuitions. I loathe myself for not thinking it over properly. I failed twice, and am now only eligible for a new non-engineering and a local college with no countrywide recognition, no job prospects . And I didn't fair well into other exams either. I did as much as I could do, but it wasn't enough. It always look liked fighting a losing battle. I do not have much options in my hand. I have developed a dislike for engineering and I can't get on board doing it now. I want to pursue non-technical fields like law, business administration and journalism, and to pursue I can give their entrances next year which would mean spending another year in home, considering I fell just short of clearing their entrances. Another thing with that is if you have difference of two years between your school and under graduation, you are overlooked for college placements, and any promising job in general.

Idk why, theres always been a part of me that just wants to hurt people. Not to mention that I physically cannot cry unless I myself is the one that is hurt, like sure I cry when my parents shout at me for extended periods of time but even that is rare and I dont think Ive cried because of anything else. Its to the point Im scared of not feeling remorse or fear. So am I a psychopath or what am I?\n",

      "suicide - Just getting some things off my chestI'm just trying to get some things off my chest, but it's a little more serious to just post any where else. I've had the big sad for a while, amongst other things. So last night I invite my buds over to drink, and about 4 bottles in and a few hours latter I figure the best way to check out is to drinking self to death. Its dumb, I know, but at the time I figured it was the alcohol or the tylenol, ind I've heard that tylenol is one terrible way to go. So I start drinking more, and more. Well at some point my mindset was to just finish it, at all costs, and I think my friends realized this and tried to cut me off. I dont remember what all happened, but i do remember at some point it got physical and I hurt my friends, I choked one out and got in a fight with the other two. Well I woke up today about an hour ago and all I can think about is how I hurt those that were trying to protect me so I could end it, and it makes me sad, I betrayed myself and my friends, and they where almost not able to stop me. I for one my whole life have told myself I will never fight those closest to me, it sounds even dumber than what I said before, but me and my buds are some rough housing bastards, and I've always said I would never hurt them. But now I find myself hurting them, the ones who care about me, just so I can end my life. And it's all I can think about now, how I always just end up hurting people for my own selfish needs, It's kind of making things worse. I dont want any one reading this thinking I'm going to kill myself right now, but the time may come one day, just I know as long as my family are alive I sont want them to have to see me die, or dead. Drunk me just figured nothing else mattered so why not now. Sorry if this all sounds wacky but I just had to tell some one, afterall its easier to tell people things like this that you will never meet or hear. I just had to get this off my chest, and I've never told any one things like this before.\n",

Personally, I am stressed out alot with homework, college, extra curricular activities, family problems, etc. All of which have brought me down.

I know how you feel, the dread that everytime that you step outside could be there last.

We read through old text conversations (between ourselves) on my phone and at one point she put her elbow on my shoulder like you would put your elbow on the window of a car to rest. This was definitely pretty unusual, as we aren't touchy people and the only physical contact we'd ever had was fake hitting each other or wrestling for something, like a phone. Anyways, at one point we got to some photos that she sent in messages and she tried to take my phone so we wouldn't look at them, but I pulled it away and basically ended up lying down on the bed trying to keep it away. Usually at this point she would just give up or maybe reach around to grab it, but she just laid on top of me with one hand on it and eventually gave up, but didn't move, and rested her head on my shoulder/chest for what was probably half an hour before it was super late and we both decided we should try to get some sleep. We slept for maybe an hour (in separate beds) before someone made a loud noise in the hallway and we both woke up, although her sister somehow slept through it. E came back and sat above the pillows and played with my hair for a while, which was also unusual. Then she said she was tired and crawled down into the bed and just laid next to me for the better part of an hour. Keep in mind that this is an extremely small bed and there was nothing comfortable about this from a needing to sleep perspective. Then her sister started to shuffle around and E jumped up quickly, and at that point we were all up and went about our day. No mention of anything at all, except for one point in the morning where E made some awkward compliments about my hair and eyes.\n",

      "The next night was the same situation, except L fell asleep much faster and E came over to my bed again, and this time put her head on my shoulder pretty much right away. We were both very tired since we barely slept the night before, and she laid down again next to me and said she was tired and asked me to put my phone away, which I did. We laid down for a while until she said she was going to go sleep. She also patted the top of my head when she said this which was an interesting gesture and I still don't exactly understand that. Anyways, she sat up and then gave up on standing up and laid back down, and about 10 minutes later she did the exact same thing and eventually got up and went to sleep. Notably, every time her sister kind of shuffled or the door creaked or something, E sat or stood up, so she clearly didn't want other people seeing what was going on... \n",

      "It's been over 3 weeks since the trip, and while we've texted every day as usual since, there has been essentially no mention of these nights except for her saying that she misses the pullout couch bed because \"it was comfortable.\" I really cannot stress enough how nothing like this has ever happened between us before, how even a year ago her accidentally brushing my leg made her say \"ew.\" Also of note, I didn't really initiate any contact or anything. I went along with it because I didn't mind at all, but she did initiate basically everything. I really just don't know what to do now. The last thing I want to do is jeopardize a good friendship, but I am also curious about why she did what she did those two nights. \n",

I can't get it out of my mind, but thinking about it makes me feel sick. Compounding with my depression there have been at least 2 days this month where I spent the entire day crying and dry-heaving. If I'm not crying because of that I'm crying because of the pain in my arm. The only thing my insurance really pays for is certain medications so I've been taking advantage of that. But it takes me 6 Aleve and 3 Gabapentin just to feel slightly okay. But I can't take that many pills every time my pain flares up because I'd be going through a prescription bottle a day. The only reason I'm not dead right now is because I spent the last 10 years of my life waiting for Infinity War. That's how pathetic my life is. Waiting for a movie before I end everything.\n",

I hid it well for months as I was going through my \"emo phase\" and wore bracelets almost all the way up to my elbow so no one noticed it. The only reason anyone found out is because I forgot my school jumper one day and my teacher made me remove all of the bracelets. My parents were contacted and I got one of the worst lectures of my life. My little sister didn't completely understand but it was obvious that she was scared for me.\n",

One morning my parents and I have a huge argument as they try to raid my bag for cigarettes (there weren't any in there but I was an emotional ass child) it ends up with me and my mum in tears and my 8 year old sister screaming that she hated her life. That was what really pushed me over the edge... I had the bottle of paracetamol in my bedroom as I had abdominal pains. I don't know what came over me but I took as many as I could before going to school... My friend found out and reported it and I was rushed to hospital. I had to stay in and have my system pumped and my liver monitored as I'd killed almost half of it. I recovered well but it didn't change the way I felt about life and how much I wanted to just end it all but I didn't try again for the sake of my sister.\n",

We go to the clinic to talk about the procedure and on the way home we talk about everything and decide we cant go through with it. This is our child after all! I tell my parents... they kick me out of their house so I move in with my boyfriend and his family. It all went well until the rumors started and he finds out that something happened with me and another guy before I fell pregnant. We argue and my mum and dad take me back home but I stay with my boyfriend for the sake of our baby. I didn't have an easy pregnancy, I fell down the stairs, had a kidney infection, ended up with my knee in my stomach, get pushed into walls at school and more but I never damaged my baby.

After we broke up, I ended up moving back to my hometown about an hour away. She told me she wanted to \"work on herself\" and then I ended up finding out she cheated on me with a guy I was worried about, and is now in a relationship with a different guy I was worried about who she always called a douche bag and shit like that. They became Facebook official today, her family and MY friends commenting on the post. Little do they know, a month ago she was telling me she wanted to be with me forever. She lied to me, strung me along, and broke my fucking heart, and now she is telling her family, her friends, and my friends lies about me  and our relationship, calling me crazy, a stalker, and I don't know what to feel. I know nobody knows the truth except for me and her(like i said there is a lot more i can elaborate on). It sucks to be the victim and the bad guy somehow. I have no friends, and nobody cares about how I feel. Prior to this I had a pretty fucked up life, got a DUI when I was 20, which completely halted all of the \"dream\" jobs I've had permanently. I'm lost as fuck. I know I'm smart, I'm a good looking guy, I'm funny, but I have nothing. I have no path, I'm not close to finishing my degree, and I just feel like nobody cares about me, which sucks because I don't even care about myself.

Both of them are around 30 – 40 questions long I believe, and all results for the surveys will remain anonymous to both me, and everyone else viewing the study. \n",

      "Regarding the introversion/extroversion survey it says that you will need to pay 6.00 something dollars for the full answer, however I can get everything I need from the free snapshot it gives you lmbo, to know your results 0 – 49 means introverted, and 51 – 100 is extroverted (50 is ampiverted). \n",
      "\n",
      "For the second survey there will be more detail in the description of the survey, but the questions will be in the form of statements, and you will answer them by ranking from 1 – 7 based on how much you agree with said statement (low being disagree, and high being agree). Of course if you have any questions, concerns, or want to leave the study just comment below and I’ll respond as soon as possible.\n",

I quickly grabbed my sweatshirt to hide it and I’ll say I made sure no one got even a glimpse and my arms or wrists. What would people say if they saw my arms all red with marks all over? I don’t even know what came over me to push me to harm myself. I genuinely wanted to bleed I genuinely wanted to. I felt horrible all day, to anxious to talk to people besides teachers and the few people I can somewhat consider my friends. Never said a word about what I did or felt.

      "suicide - Trying not to spiral outMy past year of life has been the roughest one ever, and at the age of 26 I am having a really hard time keeping my head up. I have ADD (diagnosed) and most likely depression (not diagnosed) and this past year has me spinning out hard. My highs are great, I beam happiness and inspire people around me, or so I am told. But my lows make me feel like there is no reason to keep continuing this life. In this year I have, failed out of school for the second time with no degree and 120k in debt. I lost my dog which was the only thing keeping me in contact with my parents about 3 months ago. I have no job and my girlfriend of 3 1/2 years just broke up with me over this past weekend citing that we are toxic to one another. I can see her side because I isolate myself from her and my friends and spend ~10 hours or more a day on my computer at my lowest points. I feel so disconnected from society that the only way that I actually feel good is when I am at a rave or festival fucked up. All of my actual friends live over an hour and a half away, and if I did decide to move back to where my parents live it would put them closer to three hours away. I also live with my ex-gf at this point and am not even sure about whether to just say fuck it and leave or to stay and push through. I feel like seeing her everyday is going to kill me inside knowing that we're not together, but at the same time just cutting ties and running as far away as I can will hurt the same. She has said to me that she would be down with the idea of us trying again at a later date, but I am not really a person who makes the same mistake twice so I almost don't even want to entertain that idea. My support systems feel like they are failing and I feel like any friends I have made at school are more my ex-gf's friends than actually my friends. I'm just trying to find meaning to my life because it feels like everything is crumpling away and I can't really see a reason to continue.\n",

So she said hey back and I have a class with her friend so she was like I know him (the girl doesn’t really know me I don’t her we ever had a class together and I’m quiet). So I was asking her and her fiend/sister some questions and I said ask me some also so they did. It went pretty well at least for me but now I’m starting to think about her like before I sleep and wake up and I don’t want another crush. One reason is because I don’t really see her so how can I talk to her another reason is I don’t think she knows what I look like and the most important reason is that I can’t talk to girls or anyone really. The same thing happens every time I have a crush, I like the girl I want to talk to her but I chicken out and if by some miracle I do, I make it kinda awkward and they don’t have interest and if I try dming I always get ignored or dry replies so I don’t want to do that. And because every time my crush is right there and I can talk to her but don’t or they seem really uninterested as far as not wanting to be friends it makes me sad, really sad and maybe even depressed and since all my crushes were like this I don’t like them. So idk if you have any advice on what I should do please tell me.\n",

He was so cold to me after the breakup and moved on so quickly from me. I lost all of my friendships because I prioritized him over everyone else in my life even myself. My friends hate me. I told them I was feeling really sad and depressed and they haven’t checked up on me at all. No one has texted me for the past two weeks and I have just been at home suffering. My college experience is coming to an end and I have made no friends since the start of my freshman year. I failed to join a sorority last year and dropped it because I was too overwhelmed and going through a huge loss and now I watch as all of the people I met through that experience are thriving and well and I’m left with nothing. I have no real friends and my ex was the only one who made me feel loved and cared about. I want to attempt to join another sorority but there’s too much history and no one is gonna want me especially cause I’m a junior so there goes my chance to meet new people and make new friends.

As a kid, it was all about my birth giver staying in bed, hungover, getting drunk, making it clear the whole day was an inconvenience to her, so it never happened.

My friends and family don’t bother with presents or cards or even calls or texts because over the years my birthgiver’s conditioning of them that I don’t mean anything and am not worth being kind to has worked, and this year I am 6 months pregnant, it’s my first year without my dad who died last year (the only person who ever made this day okay and who ever loved and protected me), and my partner thought today would be a good day to tell me that we haven’t in fact paid the right fees on our rented home and our landlord has put the house back on the market to let, evidenced by the sign that has appeared at our front door today. I went through a terrible episode of mental health when my dad died (the day after I found out I was pregnant), I have schizoaffective disorder and fell into a deep, suicidal depression. With the help of nobody else I climbed out of it, knowing that I had my child and that this was more important and things would get better. Things didn’t get better, and they never have or will.

I hung a rope with so bad knots thats when i finally pushed the chair beneath me it got loose and i was on ground. After that it took me good 40 minutes to get my breath back as i was going through shock and couldn’t move my body. After getting into my senses i called my friends and told them about it. Then i was moved to stay with my aunt. All everyone wanted then was a reason so that they could help me with it. I wont be able to make them understand that i was done with myself. I hate myself to a point that no matter how good i do i eventually end up fucking everything else. I have recognised that i have a self destructing behaviour and i simply cant go on with it. I don’t know what kind of help i need. I was kind of grateful that i survived but its been 12 days and i feel that what i am living right now is just borrowed time and i don’t belong here. I have no intentions to do it again because now i know that our body fights back and i am too coward to choose any other way. Maybe i need to learn to be happy with myself.

Anything I show the slightest bit of interest in, she either discourages because it's \"weird\" and \"people will laugh at you\" or she tries to make it about herself more than me. Then she doesn't understand why I won't share my interests with her, thinks I in fact have no interests, and resorts to dragging me to things *she* wants to go to in order to \"draw me out of my shell.\" She doesn't understand that I need to have interests and hobbies that don't involve her.

There's also the obvious fact that nobody wants to hang around with a crazy person who needs prescribed meds just to not feel suicidal. I don't see a way out of this that doesn't involve me dying.

I am lashing out majorly where I have even wrote \"f\\*ck you\" on a piece of paper with my own blood and sent it to someone. I am not doing okay but all of those I have cared for are slowly hating me one by one because I can't control my emotions and I don't trust myself around anyone I feel if not myself I will seriously hurt someone.

One time I was having a really bad day and I vented to her and she ghosted me for 2 months and then excused it by saying “i didn’t know what to say.” She also talks bad about her other close friends to me and even asked me to tell one of her friends that he stinks for her.

      "non-suicide - 2nd time postingHi everyone. This is my second time posting and I’m honestly surprised I’m even here to make it. It’s my 20th birthday today. I have a severe case of strep throat. Today I woke up feeling better than I had in a few days. Less achy and sore. My mom was wonderful and make me my favorite breakfast and the Chiefs won. I still feel empty. I went to watch Netflix in the other room and my mom makes a comment about putting my dog down. I visit my grandma and grandpa because they’re my favorite people on earth. I help her write an email and I feel needed but still so empty. I love her. I stay so late at her house that I can’t make it to my home at college so I have to create an outfit for dinner in what I have at home and I don’t like it. I have to do my hair and makeup with what’s there too. I came home in a hurry after I got found out I was sick. My mom and dad leave before me to get a table at the restaurant for all of us. I’m running very late. I get in my car to find my gas light is on because, even though I just got it this week, there’s a problem and my dad needed to look at it. So my mom drove it to and from work and for any errands she needs. I have to fill it up at the scary gas station and get stared down by a scary man. But I’m not scared. I’m hoping he’ll do something bad. I drive all the way to my college town and pick up my two friends. One of whom is very sweet and says “oh I totally understand why you’re late” and the other continues to make comments about me being incapable of being on time to anything. We go to dinner and I try to talk but in crowds I shut down. Nothing I have to say is worth anything anyway. My friends talk more to each other than me. After we all leave my friends continue to talk to each other more and more. They even decide to take the dog on a walk without me because they’ve my throat hurts and I wouldn’t want to come. They yell up at me that I need to move my car for a neighbor and I leave. They do not text me. They do not call. They do not ask where I went or why I went there. I finally text one of them to explain and she responds with she’s sorry but she stays. I continue to explain and she continues to stay where she is. On my birthday with a friend I introduced her to. I finally explode in a long winded text about how it’s happened to me many times that I introduce friends and then get kicked out. I tell her that her “I love you” and her “I’m sorry” doesn’t mean anything because she’s still doing the thing she’s “sorry” for. I am now selfish because I don’t want them to hang out without me. I texted my mom about this. She hasn’t respond. All of this proves to me I have no one. My grandma couldn’t wait to talk about my cousins. Or my brother’s girlfriend. Or why don’t I have a boyfriend. I chose the restaurant because my friend is celiac and she can eat their food. But I am a doormat. I do not matter. I am empty. There are moments when a flame flickers inside me but not for long before someone or something puts it out. I am 20. I have fought for 20 years. I do not want to fight for 20 more. Or 10 more. Or even another day. I’ve made it to 20 and I can say it really doesn’t get better.\n",

And she cared for me and told me to get out. But I refused to listens because I saw the guy at the top make 15k in a week. So I yelled at her in rage. And I kept listening to these guys until about august, I am still working for them, and at this point I am homeless and living off the street, but the only thing that is keeping me going is maybe one day I will see her again and we might be again, in September I broke down and almost jumped off of a bridge, but I swear I could hear her. So I called someone and my father who I told to fuck off because I wanted to be rich in this job picks me up and takes me to his house. Now I am really close to being near her again but I don't want to cause her pain, she is with someone new and is moving on. But the more I come to accept reality the heavier I get the hard it is to move, the more I start to believe that it's impossible and the more I feel as though I failed every test I was given. I tried to move on in the past but, I can't not this one. She is where I went when it was the darkest, but the closer I get to crossing her path again and see that she moved on. The closer it's becoming easier for me to jump off a bridge. I am not seeing away out of it. I know what is said suicide is a permanent solution for a temporary problem, but I can't see an end to this problem. What do I do?   \n",

To just be gone, and either celbrate with him or never feel anything again? Why do anything?\n",

      "suicide - What if he's rightI'm too tired to really type out any real details. I've had ideation for a very very long time. Last year there was a period of time where that lifted, and I felt on top of the world. During that time I met someone. tl;dr he ended up telling me that people like me don't get love and then ghosting me. There's a lot more details than that but I just really can't go over everything.\n",

I at least have a close friend at work now but she lives kind of far. I don't want her to think less of me for feeling so bad about all this, even though that could be wrong. Basically this has confirmed every fear that I have about myself. That I'm worthless. That I'm forgettable. Undesirable. Worthless. Worthless. Worthless. And it's brought back my ideation so hard. I don't even know what to do. I'm too scared to do anything, always too scared. But I'm alone in this. I feel too heavy to move on with my life, and I don't know what to do. I'm so scared because I'm 27 and it's like how am I going to find someone to marry and have a family with anytime soon? What if I just never have that and i reeally am alone forever? What if he's right, what if he's happy and I'm not? What did I do wrong?\n",

      "suicide - I’m ready to end my life right now.I just turned 20 and as of the last few weeks I’ve had serious thoughts of suicide. I’ve had thoughts of suicide before and going as far as leaving a suicide note, but had never acted on it. This is the first time I’ve felt compelled to post about this or tell anyone for that matter because the thoughts are getting worse by the day. My life isn’t horrible and I’ve been doing very well for myself since becoming an electrician and have had a solid group of friends for years. For some reason I feel an emptiness and my depression is getting worse. I’ve been having recurring nightmares of me dying in very traumatic ways and have been crying a lot. I don’t know what to do and I guess this is a last ditch effort of turning for help. The one thing that’s stopping me from committing suicide is thinking of my mother and knowing how she would react. She’s a recovering alcoholic who just got over a divorce with my father and has really gotten her life together since then. I don’t want to throw a wrench in her life and her having to grieve over her son who decided to be selfish and killed himself. I’ve been thinking about that a lot and my mom being the only reason I haven’t done it, but I’ve been justifying suicide more often than not now. I need serious help and don’t know who to turn to. \n",

I constantly think of all the different ways I can off myself and quiet frankly none of those thoughts even make me second guess death.  I just want it now and I feel like no matter the path I take sooner than later I'm gonna put myself into the ground.    Im just tired of always being angry and always being depressed \n",
      "suicide - I'm gonna commit by October 1stThe reason I have come to this conclusion is as stated in my last SuicideWatch post. My super mega plus ultra crush, Isaac, isn't dating anyone because (presumably) his girlfriend cheated or something. Anyway, this destroyed me and all my happiness. I was surviving on the fact that he could still say yes, so this news devastated me. So, I know all you guys are gonna say that I should just get over him or I'll be over him soon. But I start to doubt it more and more everyday, because my obsession just keeps growing and growing more and more and it's just horrible. I love him so much that I would give him everything if it meant just one day with him. If he heard that though, he would never want to talk to me again because he would be really creeped out. That's the one problem that was keeping us apart. He's creeped out by almost everything I do. I admit, I have done really creepy stuff to him in the past, so it's probably my fault that he felt/feels that way. But anyway, that one of the big reasons for me committing suicide. I have a few more, but those would make this thing too big, I'm only putting up my main reason. I say that I'm gonna do it by October, but I'll probably do it tonight or tomorrow. \n",
